<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the present volume, a brief outline of events in
Filipinas during the period 1801&ndash;40 serves as a background and
setting for the following surveys of political, social, and economic
conditions in the islands during that period. Of these, one is made by
an English naval officer who had visited the islands, another by a
Spanish official of long experience, and a third (presented in
synopsis) by a merchant familiar with the commerce of the Orient and
the Americas. These different accounts (written at nearly the same
time) furnish most valuable knowledge of the Philippines and their
people, and their needs and possibilities; and at the same time they
reflect the more enlightened and liberal ideas of policy and
administration which had gained a foothold in Spain, and which the
recent loss of her other colonies had made her more willing to put in
practice in Filipinas.</p>
<p>The leading events in Philippine history during the first four
decades of the nineteenth century are briefly epitomized from Montero y
Vidal&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Historia de Filipinas</i>. Governor Aguilar
opposes the appointment of native secular priests to the curacies,
regarding them as unfit for these posts. During his term, he introduces
public street-lighting, paved sidewalks, and vaccination in Manila, and
various other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>beneficial measures; he attempts, but with little
success, to check the piracies of the Moros, and is compelled to desist
therefrom by news of the war between England and Spain, and the
consequent danger to Manila. At his death (August 8, 1806) an officer
named Folgueras becomes governor <i lang="la">ad interim</i>; he
strengthens the fortifications of Manila, and quells a revolt in
Ilocos. He is succeeded (March 4, 1810) by the new proprietary
governor, Gonz&aacute;lez Aguilar, who promotes cattle-raising in the
provinces, quells another insurrection in Ilocos, publishes the first
newspaper in Filipinas, and proclaims the Spanish constitution of 1812.
In 1813 arrives his successor, Jos&eacute; de Gardoqui, whose rule is
by no means easy; for he is opposed by corrupt royal officials, and has
to encounter revolts among the Indians caused by the publication of the
new Spanish constitution&mdash;disturbances which are aggravated by the
despotic acts of Fernando VII on regaining his crown (1814). Gardoqui
prohibits the introduction and use of opium in the islands, strengthens
the fortifications of Cavite, puts down banditti and smugglers, and in
many other ways benefits the colony; he dies in December, 1816, and is
succeeded by Folgueras. The latter revives the Economic Society, and
founds a nautical academy. In 1820 occurs the first epidemic of cholera
morbus, which is unfortunately accompanied by a massacre of the
foreigners in Manila, executed by the credulous Indians who have been
persuaded by malicious persons that the pest was caused by the
foreigners having poisoned the waters. Mart&iacute;nez, who becomes
governor on October 30, 1822, brings over a number of Spanish officers
for the Filipinas regiments; this creates jealousy among the officers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>who had come from America, which results in a
mutiny among them and part of the troops in Manila (June, 1823); this
is put down, and the leaders are shot. An expedition is sent against
the Moros (1824), which lays waste their shores.</p>
<p>On October 14, 1825, Mart&iacute;nez is replaced by Mariano Ricafort
as governor; the latter is also made chief of the treasury. The parish
curacies are, by a royal decree in 1826, restored to the regular
orders. In 1827 the naval bureau is re&euml;stablished at Manila, under
Pascual Enrile, who succeeds Ricafort as governor in 1830. (Both these
men were among the most illustrious rulers of Filipinas, on account of
their ability, uprightness, and zeal for the public welfare.) In 1828
the insurgent mountaineers of Bohol are finally subdued, and reduced to
villages. Various royal decrees are obtained for the promotion of
agriculture, manufactures, and other industries; and for obliging the
Chinese to live in villages, like the Indians. Several important
reforms in the administration and the social conditions of the colony
are instituted by these two governors, and Enrile is especially active
in building highways and providing other means of communication to
bring the inland and the maritime provinces into communication with
each other.</p>
<p>In 1836, Governor Salazar has to enforce the laws forbidding the
sale of firearms and powder to the enemies of Spain; he also makes a
treaty of commerce with the Joloans, which does not, however, restrain
them from piracy. In 1837, he urgently requests the Spanish government
to send more Spanish friars to the islands as parish priests. The
political disturbances in Spain at this time are reflected in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>Filipinas, and a strong Carlist faction oppose
Governor Camba (who assumes that office in August, 1837), and finally
procure his recall to Spain, little more than a year afterward. Under
his successor, Lardiz&aacute;bal, the status of the Chinese in the
islands is determined, provision is made for the official censorship of
books brought to Filipinas, a school of commerce is established at
Manila and various important changes are made in financial and
municipal administration. In February, 1841, Lardiz&aacute;bal is
succeeded by Marcelino de Or&aacute;a.</p>
<p>In 1828 was published at Calcutta an interesting book entitled,
<i>Remarks on the Phillippine Islands, 1819 to 1822</i>, &ldquo;by an
Englishman&rdquo;&mdash;as he states therein, a naval officer; this is
here presented, with additional annotations from various sources. It
throws much light on conditions in Manila at that time, and is of
especial value as coming from an enlightened foreigner, rather than a
Spaniard. He praises the natural resources and advantages of the
islands, and makes various comments on their climate (which &ldquo;is
remarkably temperate and salubrious&rdquo;), diseases, and population;
he then classifies this last, describing in succession the various
races, white, colored, and mixed, who inhabit the islands. He defends
the natives from accusations which have been made against them, and
considers their defects as the natural result of the oppression and
injustice which they have suffered, and the general insecurity of
property in the islands. Robbery and piracy prevail there, outside of
the new Spanish towns; and even in Manila there are numerous acts of
pillage committed by the lawless soldiery. Justice is neglected or
corrupted; and the Church exacts so many holidays, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>pilgrimages, etc., that the natives are obliged to
neglect their fields, and tend to become idle and dissipated; they also
are burdened by many church taxes and impositions. Our writer proceeds
to describe the government of the islands, general, municipal, and
provincial, and the abuses prevalent in the last-named; then the
ecclesiastical administration, the character of the clergy, and their
influence over the natives. The sources of the colonial revenue are
enumerated, with the chief branches of expense, the main part of this
being for the military and naval forces, both of which are mismanaged,
ill-disciplined, poorly paid, and of course very inefficient.
Agriculture is &ldquo;yet in its infancy,&rdquo; as a result partly of
the oppression of the natives, partly of the expulsion of the
Jesuits&mdash;who did more than any others to civilize the
Indians&mdash;and partly of the restrictions on commerce, which now are
less oppressive; yet the country is almost incredibly fertile. The
implements used in tillage are described, with the methods of
cultivating the chief products, and that of refining the sugar produced
there; and the reasons are given why Europeans have been unable to
engage in agriculture with success. The mineral products of the islands
are enumerated. Commerce is, like agriculture, still undeveloped; our
author attributes this to the Acapulco trade, to the prohibitory system
pursued by Spain and to the monopoly allowed to the Philippine Company,
and criticises Spain&rsquo;s policy toward her colonies. He then
describes the condition of Philippine commerce, with statistics of
1818; and the difficulties under which it labors&mdash;especially the
insecurity of property and contracts, the fraudulent dealings of the
Chinese merchants; and the neglect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>of government to prevent
smuggling or to make suitable provision for re&euml;xportation of
goods&mdash;which have prevented Manila from being one of the great
centers of Oriental trade.</p>
<p>The second part of these &ldquo;Remarks&rdquo; is devoted to Manila;
a description of the city, its fortifications (which our writer
considers very inefficient on the side next to Pasig River), streets,
public buildings, mode of constructing houses, and the public cemetery;
and social conditions there, which are unfavorable to morality and the
development of character. The author criticises the colonial policy of
Spain, and regards her tenure of rule over Filipinas as precarious,
especially as discontent and ideas of political freedom are spreading
among the Indians.</p>
<p>Of unusual interest and value is a memorial written (April 26, 1827)
by Manuel Bernaldez Pizarro, on the &ldquo;causes which antagonize the
security and progress of the Filipinas Islands,&rdquo; and which bring
about their backward condition, with the measures which he judges
desirable for their correction. As a high official in Filipinas during
seventeen years, his opinions are of much importance, especially as he
was evidently a clear-sighted and upright statesman, a keen observer,
and a logical thinker&mdash;albeit he was, like the majority of
government officials, still much under the sway of autocratic and
regalistic notions&mdash;and was fertile in ideas and projects for
improving the condition of Filipinas. The memorial is methodically
arranged in sections relating to military affairs, Moro piracies,
land-titles, Spanish vs. native clerics, the residence of foreigners in
the islands, character of government officials, administration of
justice, taxes and revenue, commerce, agriculture, manufactures, etc.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>On each of these subjects he presents a concise statement of present
conditions and tendencies, followed by his recommendations for change,
reform, or suppression. In the army, the principal difficulty lies in
the corps of officers, partly Peninsular and partly native or American,
with Indian subalterns; these classes have almost nothing in common,
and the latter are dangerously near to the Indians, or are spoiled by
the tendencies of the country. Provision should be made, therefore, for
sending officers from Spain to fill all posts of command. Instead of
enlarging the military force, a central location (afterward indicated
as Cavite) should be selected, and rendered impregnable to assault, in
which the government and the Spanish population of Manila might be safe
in any revolution or other dangerous emergency; Manila is not
sufficiently fortified for such a purpose. The piracies of the Moros
are ruining the islands; the only way to check them is to conquer
Jol&oacute; and Mindanao with a powerful expedition, and colonize them
from the Visayas. The Indian villages are often much too large to be
properly directed in either spiritual or civil matters, and should be
made smaller, with stricter police patrol. Measures should be taken to
authenticate and confirm the titles to landed property, which at
present are confused and unreliable. Much harm is caused by the
ignorance, unfitness, and immorality of the Indian and mestizo clerics;
they not only neglect their priestly duties, but have dangerous
tendencies to revolution; as soon as this is practicable, all such
should be replaced by European friars. Bernaldez descants upon their
virtues and their ability to rule the Indians well, and advises the
government &ldquo;to maintain as many religious as possible in the
islands, and give them as much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>political authority as is
consistent with their ministry.&rdquo; Foreigners are undesirable as
residents in Filipinas, especially exiles, idlers, and stowaways; and
even Spaniards from the Peninsula should be compelled to return thither
after a certain period. Strict residencias should be required from the
alcaldes-mayor, as many of them are unfit to hold that office, and
commit crimes which render them dangerous to the peace of the
provinces. Greater care should be exercised in the selection of all
government officials, in order to correct the laxity which everywhere
characterizes the administration of the islands. There is pressing
necessity for better means of communication with the mother-country,
which can best be promoted by encouraging her commerce with Filipinas.
The governors and intendants should be obliged to furnish the reports
and information about the country which the laws require; and there
should be more co&ouml;peration between the governor and the Audiencia.
Private persons of means should be encouraged and aided to undertake
the enterprises which the country needs. Various specified abuses in
the administration of justice should be corrected; and the trading
alcaldes-mayor should be replaced by corregidors, who should be able
and experienced lawyers. The tributes ought to be paid in money, and
not in kind; and this involves the need of a colonial money for
Filipinas. The revenue taxes, especially those on tobacco and wine,
should receive more attention, and these two should be extended to all
the provinces; and the manufacture and sale of brandy in the islands
should be restricted. The Chinese in the islands should be carefully
classified, more strictly supervised by the government, and more
heavily taxed. The rebate of duties granted on all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>foreign
imports at Manila is ruining the Filipinas manufacturers, whose
&ldquo;infant industries&rdquo; should be protected; and Bernaldez
proposes a new schedule, carefully classified. The inter-island trade
is exclusively in the hands of the alcaldes-mayor and the rich Chinese
and mestizos, who should therefore pay a moderate tax on that lucrative
commerce. A colonial currency is urgently needed. An account of the
management of the obras p&iacute;as should be demanded by the
government, and those funds should be employed in promoting agriculture
and industry in the islands. The shipbuilding and mining carried on by
the government ought to be furnished by private persons under contract.
Agriculture is the most important industry of Filipinas, and a feeder
to its commerce; its backward condition should be remedied. He
recommends direct and unlimited commerce between Spain and the islands,
government encouragement to large agricultural enterprises, instruction
of the Indians in better methods of agriculture and the preparation of
its products, and rewards for industry and application on their part.
The production of opium for the Chinese market ought to be allowed in
Filipinas, and heavy duties collected on its exportation. Enormous sums
of money are yearly carried to India and China for fine cotton goods,
which could as well be manufactured by the Filipinos if they knew how
to dye these properly and had machinery for spinning the cotton thread;
the government should take active and prompt measures to secure this
desirable end. Closer relations should be established with Spain, whose
government and merchants are urged to work together in behalf of this.
Bernaldez concludes by showing &ldquo;the necessity of forming a
special code of laws for Filipinas,&rdquo; and of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>&ldquo;a
periodical visitation of that colony by officials from the
Peninsula.&rdquo; As appendix to his memorial, we present a summary of
a similar document, written at nearly the same time by a merchant of
long and varied commercial experience in the Orient and the Americas.
Less official and formal, but more shrewd, alert, and liberal, this
writer presents his views, with much clearness and force, on the
decadence of the islands and the means of making them more prosperous
and wealthy; and a comparison of these with the opinions of Bernaldez
might well be helpful to the present administration of Filipinas.</p>
<p>In an appendix to this volume we present a brief account of the
three Spanish Cortes in which the Philippines had representation; all
these sessions occurred in the early part of the nineteenth century,
one of the most disturbed and critical periods of Spain&rsquo;s
national existence. The most important measures of these Cortes
concerning the Philippines were, the suppression of the Acapulco-Manila
galleon and the abolition of the privileges formerly granted to the
Compa&ntilde;ia de Filipinas. In each of these assemblies efficient
representation of the islands was barred by their distance from Spain
and the difficulty of communication with that country, while, in
general, political development was very backward. The final ruling, in
the Constitution of 1837, by which special laws were devised for the
government of Ultramar, appears to have been the only possible solution
of the difficulty (at least for the Philippines). Finally, we furnish a
list of the archbishops of Manila during the Spanish r&eacute;gime.</p>

may be found a brief summary of events during the latter third of the
eighteenth century, a record which is here continued as above. As
before, we epitomize from Montero y Vidal&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Hist. de
Filipinas</i> (tomo ii, pp. 360&ndash;573; iii, pp. 6&ndash;32), using

quotation marks.]</p>
<p>Under Governor Aguilar the &ldquo;Ordinances of good
government,&rdquo; as revised by Governor Raon in 1768 (for which see
VOL. L, pp. 191&ndash;264), were reprinted in the year 1801. &ldquo;On
September 8, 1804, Don Fray Juan Antonio Zulaibar, a Dominican, and
formerly a professor in the university of Alcal&aacute;, took
possession of the archbishopric of Manila.&rdquo; In November
following, the governor sent despatches to the king explaining his
action in appointing to certain curacies regular instead of secular
priests, saying that the latter were seldom qualified for those
charges. He said, in regard to this: &ldquo;No one is ignorant how
different are the appearance and the degree of prosperity of all the
churches and settlements administered by religious from those in the
villages which are in charge of Indian clerics. Of the latter, some are
doubtless men of virtue and pious intentions; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>in
general it is notorious that, on account of their origin, lack of
education, the very obscure condition in which they are reared, and the
little (if any) knowledge that they possess, they do not inspire in
their parishioners that respect and veneration with which the latter
regard the religious&mdash;who, on account of being Spaniards, possess
the art of dominating the minds of the Indians, in order to maintain
them in those conditions on which depends the preservation of these
your Majesty&rsquo;s dominions. The religious know how to guide the
Indians, without violence, to whatever ends are expedient for both
religion and the State, as the results of never becoming too familiar
with the natives. The Indian clerics not only follow the opposite
course, but, lacking the dignity that belongs to their character as
priests, they mingle familiarly with their parishioners not only in
their sports, but in feasting and other things which are entirely
unfitting; and not seldom they dress themselves in the same manner as
do the natives, abandoning the very garb of their priestly
estate.&rdquo; He proceeded to say that only deplorable consequences
could result from the surrender of the curacies entirely to the native
priests; and that the religious of the orders must be employed therein,
unless they could be supplied with properly qualified secular priests
who were Spaniards. The same ideas were expressed by the municipal
council of Manila, who said of the native priests: &ldquo;The weak and
yielding disposition which has been for so long a time noticed in these
islanders does not permit in them that steadfastness which is so proper
for the priestly character and the difficult office of the care of
souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In June, 1805, the Frenchman F&eacute;lix Renouard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>de Sainte-Croix was commissioned to examine the
gold mines in Mambulao (in Camarines); and in his report he explained
that various gold mines existed there, with very rich veins, but some
were difficult to develop and others had been abandoned. By royal order
of July 5, 1805, was decreed the total independence of the Manila
custom-house, ordaining that its manager should be under the immediate
orders of the [treasury] superintendent.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e413src" href="#xd27e413" name="xd27e413src">1</a> On December 20,
1806, Aguilar created a Bureau of Vaccination at Manila, of which he
was president; and regulations were made for public vaccination, which
had a marked effect in diminishing the ravages of the smallpox. This
governor gave much attention to the construction of public works, one
of the more important of these being the highway from Manila to Cavite.
He caused the streets of the capital to be lighted at public expense,
and paved sidewalks to be built, and made the police system more
efficient; he also did much to promote domestic industries.</p>
<p>Aguilar endeavored, throughout his term of office, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>to check
the incursions of the Moros. The pirates attacked even the coasts of
Luz&oacute;n in 1793, and an expedition sent out against them in
December of that year accomplished almost nothing, being too late and
ineffective. In the following year the governor called a council of the
leading military officers and other persons experienced in Moro wars
and the affairs of the southern islands, where it was shown that the
Moros made captive some 500 persons a year, whom they rendered
slaves&mdash;excepting the old, who &ldquo;were sold to the inhabitants
of Sandakan, who sacrificed these captives to the shades of their
deceased relatives or of prominent personages,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e420src" href="#xd27e420" name="xd27e420src">2</a> preserving the
skull of the victim as a proof that they had complied with so barbarous
a usage.&rdquo; It was shown at this council that during the time from
the establishment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"
name="pb27">27</a>]</span>of the vintas in 1778 until the end of 1793
the colony had spent the sum of 1,519,209 pesos fuertes for vessels,
expeditions, wages, etc., in the warfare with the Moros, to say nothing
of the losses and destruction caused by the pirate raids. The council
resolved to abolish the present equipment of vintas and pancos,
replacing these by lanchas carrying cannon, in six divisions of six
lanchas and one panco each, with extra pay and honors to the crews; and
to repair and strengthen all the forts on the coasts liable to attack.
Aguilar attempted to open negotiations for peace with the Moro sultans;
but these had no effect, the piracies still continuing. In the summer
of 1794, a Portuguese trader of Manila who had carried goods to
Jol&oacute; was treacherously attacked on his return, when near Iloilo,
by the same Moros with whom he had traded at Jol&oacute;; but he
defended his vessel bravely, and one of the leading dattos of
Jol&oacute; was killed in the fray. In August, 1795, two vessels of the
Spanish royal navy arrived at Manila, with tidings that the English,
again at war with Spain, were planning to occupy the Filipinas Islands;
this compelled Aguilar to desist from further proceedings against the
Moros, for the time. It was hoped that &Aacute;lava and his powerful
squadron (who remained at Manila during 1797&ndash;1802) might chastise
the Moros, but nothing was accomplished in this direction&mdash;either
through fear of another English invasion, or because of the
disagreements between Aguilar and &Aacute;lava.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e431src" href="#xd27e431" name="xd27e431src">3</a> On January 21,
1798, two English ships attacked the Spanish post at Zamboanga, but
were bravely repulsed with much damage to the invaders. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>In that
year a strong force of Moros attacked the village of Baler and others
inland from the eastern coast of Luz&oacute;n [where now is the
province of Principe], constituting the oldtime missions of Ituy; they
devastated these towns, and seized four hundred and fifty captives,
among them three parish curas, one of whom was sold by them for 2,500
pesos. These pirates were established in Bur&iacute;as Island for four
years, from which center they harried the neighboring coasts. In 1799,
the authorities decided that it was more expedient that the warfare
with the Moros be carried on by the provincial authorities, with the
direction and aid of the central government; and instructions to this
effect were sent to all the alcaldes-mayor. In 1800 Aguilar established
friendly and commercial relations with Bandajar, sultan of Borneo; and
on November 4, 1805, his governor at Zamboanga, Francisco Bayot, made a
treaty of peace with Mahamad Ali Mudin, sultan of Jol&oacute;, in which
the latter agreed to forbid any foreigners to reside in his dominions
without the consent of the Spanish government, and in case of war to
close his ports to enemies of Spain. In 1804&ndash;05 English cruisers
were frequently seen off the coasts of Filipinas, and they even
attempted to capture several villages on the Mindanao coast, but were
repulsed.</p>

<p>On Aguilar&rsquo;s death (August 8, 1806), the rule of the islands
was assumed by the king&rsquo;s lieutenant at Manila, Mariano
Fern&aacute;ndez de Folgueras; and his first measures were for the
defense of Manila, as there were rumors of another attack by the
English. In the summer of 1807, there arose a rebellion in the
mountains of Ilocos Norte, begun by certain Spanish deserters from
Vigan in conjunction with some vagabond <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>Indians; afterward it
spread to many of the Ilocans, who resented the government monopoly of
wine and prohibition of native manufacture of <i>basi</i> (a liquor
produced by the fermentation of the juice of sugar cane). This revolt
was put down without much difficulty, and the leaders were hanged at
Manila; much was accomplished by the Augustinian fathers of Ilocos in
restoring peace. In February, 1809, the news arrived at Manila of the
French invasion of Spain, and the captivity of Fernando VII; the Manila
authorities promptly declared their loyalty to that monarch. Somewhat
later a French schooner of war was captured off the coast of Batangas,
and the French authorities at Isle de France endeavored to persuade
those at Manila that England, not France, was the enemy of Spain, and
that the people of Filipinas ought to support the French interests.
Folgueras answered, refusing to accept any such propositions, and would
do no more than to return the French prisoners from the captured
vessel.</p>
<p>On March 4, 1810, the new proprietary governor Manuel
Gonz&aacute;lez Aguilar, assumed his office. On February 14 preceding,
a decree had been issued by the Spanish government granting to all the
colonies in America and to Filipinas representation in the Spanish
Cortes by deputies chosen by the various capital cities. The sessions
of this Cortes began on September 24, 1810, and Filipinas was
represented therein by acting deputies; afterward, one was duly chosen
(Ventura de los Reyes) by the municipality of Manila, according to the
forms required.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e460src" href="#xd27e460"
name="xd27e460src">4</a> &ldquo;In the jurisdiction of each village in
the Philippine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>archipelago, there are extensive communal lands,
in which the natives can keep, almost without cost and easily guarded,
their herds of cattle and horses. In regard to these lands (which in
that country are called <i lang="es">estancias</i>
[&ldquo;ranches&rdquo;]), the new governor framed a useful ordinance,
which remained in force, with good results, during a long period. (It
has now fallen into disuse, and many of the communal lands have become
the property, illegally acquired, of private persons.) Important
service was rendered [to the country] by these ranches, on account of
the increase of live-stock and its great cheapness; and a positive
source of wealth for the provinces was initiated with the exportation
of their cattle.&rdquo; In the sessions of Cortes in 1811, a decree was
issued (January 26) that trade in quicksilver should be free in all the
Spanish dominions of Indias and Filipinas. In the summer of 1811, a new
rebellion broke out among the natives of Ilocos Norte, some of whose
chiefs attempted to found a new religion, in behalf of a deity whom
they called Lungao;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e471src" href="#xd27e471"
name="xd27e471src">5</a> they endeavored to persuade the heathen
mountain-dwellers of Cagayan to join them, but the insurrection was
quelled promptly by the Spaniards, and the ringleaders put to death. It
was in Gonz&aacute;lez Aguilar&rsquo;s time that the Indians were
allowed to render the services required from them for public works on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>those in their neighborhood. In order to relieve
the public anxiety and impatience caused by the dearth of news from the
mother-country, the authorities of the colony undertook to publish a
sort of gazette containing such information as was available from
Europe&mdash;mostly received through English publications that came
from Bengal. Accordingly, &ldquo;the first newspaper in Filipinas made
its appearance on August 8, 1811,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e477src" href="#xd27e477" name="xd27e477src">6</a> the second
number appearing three days later; it was published during the rest of
1811 and part of 1812, and must have ceased for lack of
material.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e483src" href="#xd27e483" name=
"xd27e483src">7</a> &ldquo;On account of the war which Espa&ntilde;a
was sustaining against the French invaders, the religious corporations
agreed to contribute with their donations toward the expenses of so
great an undertaking; the Order of Dominicans gave with that object, in
August, 1812, the sum of 36,000 pesos. On March 19 the Constitution of
1812 was promulgated at C&aacute;diz, and orders were issued that
allegiance to it should be sworn in all the towns of the monarchy. The
deputies signed it on the eighteenth, and among the signatures appears
that of Don Ventura de los Reyes.&rdquo; The Constitution was solemnly
proclaimed in Manila on April 17, 1813, and the oath of allegiance was
taken on the following day. A decree in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>Cortes (July 3, 1813)
extended to the veteran troops of the over-seas colonies the same scale
of rewards as had been recently granted to the soldiers of the
Peninsula. In that same year a special effort was made by the Spanish
government to add to its revenues by pushing in the colonies the sale
of bulls of the Crusade.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e491src" href=
"#xd27e491" name="xd27e491src">8</a></p>
<p>A new governor arrived at Manila assuming command on September 4,
1813; this was Jos&eacute; de Gardoqui Jaraveitia, who also had
appointment as chief of the naval station. This exasperated the
treasury officials, for thus the entire naval force was under one head,
that sent against the pirates [which Aguilar had stubbornly kept
separate from the naval bureau&mdash;see &ldquo;Events in
Filipinas,&rdquo; <span class="sc">VOL. L</span>, pp. 23&ndash;74]
being now taken from their control, with all its opportunities for
their personal profit; and they opposed Gardoqui in whatever he
proposed or undertook.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e502src" href=
"#xd27e502" name="xd27e502src">9</a> On February 1, 1814, a fearful
eruption <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>occurred in the volcano May&oacute;n, which
partially or wholly destroyed many villages in Albay and Camarines; hot
stones, sand, and ashes were poured forth from the crater, and villages
were thus set on fire, and their inhabitants killed. The slain numbered
12,000, besides many more seriously injured; and those who escaped lost
all their possessions. The most fertile and beautiful districts of
Camarines were converted into a desert of sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The introduction into Filipinas of the political reforms
established at the metropolis [of Madrid] were the occasion, in certain
localities of the archipelago, of lamentable disturbances of public
order. The Indians understood that the proclamation of the political
creed of 1812, solemnly made known to the country, signified exemption
from tributes and public services; and this absurd belief spread to
such an extent that the governor of the islands found himself obliged
to publish an edict on February 8, 1814, explaining the extent of the
benefits conferred [by the Constitution], and the necessity which
exists in every nation for paying contributions for supporting the
expenses of the State. These explanations did not satisfy the Indians,
and uprisings occurred in various places, principally in Ilocos Norte;
the people claimed that they ought to be relieved, as were the
notables, from polos and services, or the obligation of laboring on
public works, as bridges, highways, churches, convents, school-houses,
etc.,&mdash;an exaction which, according to them, did not go with the
equality which was established among all by the Constitution; and it
cost the alcalde-mayor of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>province his utmost efforts to
restrain the Ilocanos from violence.&rdquo; Still worse were the
effects of the renewal of absolutism in Spain, on the return of
Fernando VII from his captivity in France; for on May 4, 1814, he
issued a decree abolishing the Cortes, and nullifying its acts, and
immediately began a course of persecution and condemnation, even to
death, of all the prominent Liberals in the country. He also
re&euml;stablished in Spain the Inquisition<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e513src" href="#xd27e513" name="xd27e513src">10</a> (which had
been abolished by the Cortes on February 22, 1813), and the Society of
Jesus. When the royal decrees were received in Filipinas, the Indians
believed that they were false, and concocted in Manila; one thousand
five hundred Ilocanos seized their arms, and began plundering, killing,
and destroying throughout the province. This was mainly, however, a
rebellion of the common people (Tagal, <i lang="tl">cailianes</i>)
against the ruling class, the <i lang="es">principal&iacute;a</i> or
notables; and the latter finally took arms against the rebels, aiding
the Spaniards to suppress the insurrection. On July 20, 1814, a treaty
of peace was made between Spain and France. &ldquo;Gardoqui, by an
edict of December 1, 1814, prohibited the introduction of opium into
Filipinas, imposing on those who should violate this law six years of
confinement in a presidio and the confiscation of the opium; and to
those who were found smoking the drug a fortnight&rsquo;s imprisonment
for the first offense, thirty days for the second, and four years in
presidio for the third. A term of eight days was allowed in order that
persons who might possess unsold stocks of the said drug could deposit
them in the custom-house for reshipment to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>China.
In the said year of 1814, there was built in the environs of the town
of Laoag (Ilocos Norte) a leper hospital, at the expense of the
charitable parish priest there, Fray Vicente Febras, an Augustinian;
and this act is worthy of note, since this was the first establishment
of the kind in the provinces of the Archipelago.&rdquo; A royal decree
of August 22, 1815, re&euml;stablished the Jesuit order in the Indias
and Filipinas; and another, dated December 11, commanded the seizure in
the colonies of various political books and pamphlets, with penalties
for their use in schools. After the death of Governor Aguilar, the Moro
pirates were comparatively quiet for a time, but in 1813 they renewed
their attacks on the Spanish territories, and during several years they
harassed the latter, taking many captives, and even seizing several
vessels, both Spanish and English, on the seas. Governor Raffles, of
Java, after the restoration of that island by England to Holland,
proposed to Gardoqui that they co&ouml;perate in occupying Jol&oacute;
and Mindanao; but the Spaniard declined this, protesting against any
operations by the English in Spanish territory. &ldquo;Gardoqui, during
his term of office, caused the fortifications of Cavite to be repaired,
making them very strong; he issued orders regulating weights and
measures; he created the general administration for the revenues from
wine; and he occupied himself greatly with the improvement and
development of the tobacco plantations. The bandits, smugglers, and
gamblers had been increasing at an alarming rate; and, in order that
they might be promptly punished the governor appointed a military
commission, headed by a lieutenant-colonel. Thanks to their energetic
proceedings, the desired object was attained.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>Gardoqui&rsquo;s last days were embittered, and
his end hastened, by the treacherous act of one of his secretaries,
who, by substituting a false report for the one which Gardoqui had
dictated in favor of retaining the naval bureau, procured the
governor&rsquo;s unwitting signature to the former and thus made him
appear to report adversely to the bureau; as a result, the bureau was
suppressed by a royal decree of March 23, 1815. His disappointment and
wounded honor so grieved him that his death soon resulted (December 9,
1816).</p>
<p>The command <i lang="la">ad interim</i> was again assumed by
Folgueras, who held it during nearly six years. On December 17, 1819,
he re&euml;stablished the &ldquo;Royal Economic Society of
Filipinas,&rdquo; as a result of royal orders to that effect issued in
1811 and 1813; and five days later its first session was held, the
governor presiding, only two members of the original society being
still alive.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e532src" href="#xd27e532" name=
"xd27e532src">11</a> A month later, it met again, with sixty new
members, and Manuel Bern&aacute;ldez was chosen director of the
association; and its new ordinances <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>were approved by the governor on
July 24 following. Folgueras, learning that certain immunities and
advantages had been granted to Cuba and Puerto Rico for the
encouragement of agriculture, requested from the home government
similar help for Filipinas; the crown decreed an investigation of the
subject, but the fulfilment of this was delayed from time to time, so
that not until 1848 was even a definite statement and proposal for
action in this direction made.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e537src" href=
"#xd27e537" name="xd27e537src">12</a> (This was done by Rafael
D&iacute;az Arenas, one of the four members of the Economic
Society&mdash;to which the investigation had been referred&mdash;who
had been appointed to prepare the data for a report to the crown;
&ldquo;but we do not know whether the Society accepted his proposal, or
whether it reached any definite conclusion on the subject.&rdquo;) In
October of the year 1820, Manila was ravaged by a terrible epidemic of
smallpox, which was especially fatal in the villages along the Pasig
River; the corregidor of Tondo therefore issued an edict prohibiting
the use of the river water. A public relief committee was organized to
give the sick medical treatment and to furnish food to the poor; and
the friars and the private citizens vied with the authorities in
ministering to the victims of the pest. The medical men belonging to
the ships anchored in the bay came to the city, and did all in their
power to aid these benevolent efforts; but all these things only
confirmed in the ignorant natives the fatal idea, already spread among
them, that the disease was caused by the foreigners having poisoned the
waters and used to this end the specimens of insects and other
creatures <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>which they had collected for scientific purposes.
A crowd of armed Indians therefore gathered in the square of Binondo on
October 9, attacked the houses of the foreigners, and murdered
twenty-seven persons&mdash;among whom was not one Spaniard; nor did
they, in plundering the houses, rob any Spaniard. The governor sent out
some troops, but they accomplished nothing in checking the riot, which
ended only at nightfall; and he did nothing to prevent further crimes
of this sort, so that the mob renewed their acts of violence the next
day,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e545src" href="#xd27e545" name=
"xd27e545src">13</a> plundering and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>killing many Chinese of the
suburbs. This aroused Folgueras to activity, and he sent out a large
force of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>soldiers to pursue the assassins; but the latter
at once dispersed. A council of the authorities was called,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>but there were discordant opinions among them, and
they seem to have taken no definite action. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>municipal council of Manila called upon the
governor for the proper legal proceedings in regard to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>this
scandalous and lawless uprising; and for this purpose he appointed a
commission.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e625src" href="#xd27e625" name=
"xd27e625src">14</a></p>
<p>In October, 1820, was created the office of general intendant of
army and treasury, separate from the superior government; and it was
conferred upon Colonel Luis Urr&eacute;jola, with a salary of 5,000
pesos. In May, 1821, the Constitution of 1812 was again proclaimed in
Filipinas, only to be again abrogated in 1824, as a result of Fernando
VII&rsquo;s triumph (with French aid) over the Liberal party in Spain.
&ldquo;Folgueras gave great impulse to the Economic Society of Friends
of the Country; and he attempted to found in Manila a school of
medicine, surgery, and pharmacy, commencing for this purpose the
indispensable documentary evidence [<i lang="es">expediente</i>], but
he did not succeed in carrying out this plan&mdash;a failure much to be
regretted, because nearly all of the towns [in the islands] had neither
physician nor drug-store. As a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46"
href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>compensation, the creation of
the nautical academy was an excellent idea, for its practical results
are of great value.&rdquo; &ldquo;In 1821 appeared the second
periodical which was published in the country, entitled <i lang="es">El
Noticiero Filipino</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e642src" href=
"#xd27e642" name="xd27e642src">15</a> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;The
Philippine Intelligencer&rdquo;]; and in the same year were published
two others, <i lang="es">El Ramillete Patri&oacute;tico</i> [&ldquo;The
Patriotic Bouquet&rdquo;] and <i lang="es">La Filantrop&iacute;a</i>
[&ldquo;Philanthropy&rdquo;]. The life of all was of short
duration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Folgueras was replaced by a proprietary governor, Juan Antonio
Martinez, who began to exercise that office on October 30, 1822. He
brought with him many military officers from the Peninsula, &ldquo;a
measure counseled by Folgueras, in view of the deficiency of officers
in the regiments of Filipinas, and the little confidence which they
inspired; and this was the cause or pretext which he advanced to the
court to exculpate himself for not having adopted more energetic
measures when the melancholy assassinations were committed by the
Indians among the foreigners in 1820. The body of officers in the army
of Filipinas was almost entirely composed of American <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>Spaniards. These were greatly displeased at the
increase of Peninsular officers, partly because they supposed that thus
their own promotions would be stopped, and partly on account of race
antagonisms.&rdquo; They talked so much against the newcomers that the
governor became distrustful, and finally discovered that the American
officers were plotting and conspiring against authority; he
consequently arrested the persons suspected of this intrigue, and sent
them to Spain (February 18, 1823)&mdash;among them being Luis
Rodr&iacute;guez Varela, styled <i lang="es">El Conde Filipino</i>
[&ldquo;The Filipino Count&rdquo;];<a class="noteref" id="xd27e680src"
href="#xd27e680" name="xd27e680src">16</a> and the factor of the
Company of Filipinas, Jos&eacute; Ortega. Nevertheless, the plots
continued, and the authorities sent him who appeared to be the leader
in these, Captain Andr&eacute;s Novales, to fight the pirates in
northern Mindanao; he embarked (June 1, 1823), but was driven back by a
storm, and immediately he and his accomplices determined to
&ldquo;declare themselves openly against the authority of
Espa&ntilde;a,&rdquo; and set up a government of their own. The
insurgents (some eight hundred in number) seized the cabildo house, and
incarcerated therein the leading military chiefs and some magistrates;
then they murdered Folgueras, and took from his pockets the keys of the
city; and they fortified themselves in the royal palace, and attempted
to seize the artillery quarters. Here they were resisted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>bravely
by a few loyal officers and men, and word was conveyed to the governor,
who collected the troops available and sent these against the palace.
The insurgents there were soon overcome, and many abandoned their posts
and fled; Novales was made a prisoner, taken before a
court-martial&mdash;to whom he declared that he had no accomplices, and
was alone guilty of seducing the troops&mdash;and with the sergeant
Mateo (who had commanded the insurgent force in the palace) was shot
that afternoon, as also was Lieutenant Ruiz, who had assassinated
Folgueras. Amnesty was extended to all the remaining prisoners, except
six officers, who were shot soon afterward. On October 26, 1824, great
damage was done in Manila by a severe earthquake, which destroyed the
barracks, several churches, and many houses; and this was followed
(November 1) by a fearful hurricane, which ruined many buildings and
wrecked a multitude of sailing vessels. In this same year the Economic
Society founded a monthly periodical entitled <i lang="es">Registro

"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>out an
expedition against them (February 29, 1824), which laid waste the
shores of Jol&oacute; and southern Mindanao, and killing a considerable
number of Moros, among whom were three of their fiercest and most
treacherous dattos. Mart&iacute;nez advocated such operations as this,
as the only means of stopping the piracies of the Moros. During the
period of 1823&ndash;29, the Augustinian missionary Fray Bernardo Lago
succeeded in reducing to village life and converting more than eight
thousand Tinguianes and Igorrots in the province of Abra, forming the
mission of Pidigan. In 1825 Mart&iacute;nez was replaced by Mariano
Ricafort Palac&iacute;n y Abarca, and departed for Spain; a few days
after leaving Manila he died, and was buried in Cochinchina.</p>
<p>Ricafort assumed office on October 14, 1825, and by royal orders
also took possession of the intendancy of exchequer, although
Urr&eacute;jola was continued in its charge; but in the following
January Ricafort concluded that &ldquo;this dual command was
impossible,&rdquo; and restricted the intendant to certain routine
functions, at the same time asking the approval of the home government
for this proceeding. He had brought with him a portrait of Fernando
VII, presented by the king to his colony of Filipinas; the municipal
council of Manila decided to pay this portrait the same honors as if
the king himself had visited the islands, and during the week of
December 19&ndash;25 festivities of every kind were conducted, with the
utmost display and magnificence. (Five years later, orders from the
Spanish government were received at Manila, censuring the extravagant
expenditures on that occasion, said, to amount to some 16,000 pesos, as
an unwarranted and blamable use of municipal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>funds,
and regulating, for the future, expenditures of this sort.) A royal
decree of June 8, 1826, ordained that the secularization of parish
curacies should cease, and that those ministries should be restored to
the religious orders, which was accordingly done. On September 15 of
that year Fray Hilari&oacute;n Diez, an Augustinian, took possession of
the archbishopric of Manila, replacing Zulaibar, who had died on March
4, 1824. In June a circular letter was sent by Ricafort to the
provincial governors, reminding them of the law (art. 26 of the
&ldquo;Ordinances of good government&rdquo;) which forbade them to
hinder in any way the trade in the products of the provinces, whether
by Spaniards, natives, or mestizos, and whether in kind or with money,
ordering them to permit trade freely everywhere, without any delays or
exactions against those doing business. In 1827 Ricafort sent an
expedition against Jol&oacute;, which was kept off by the valor of the
Joloans; but the Spaniards burned and ravaged the settlements on the
shores of Illana Bay, doing the Moros much damage. In that same year
the Spanish government re&euml;stablished the naval bureau at Manila,
independent of the captain-general, and Pascual Enrile was appointed as
its chief; he proceeded to reorganize all branches of the service,
including that intended to serve against the pirates, whom he was able
to restrain to a great extent; and he constructed several cruisers and
other vessels, one of which remained in active service for forty years.
He established the jurisdiction of the bureau throughout the
archipelago, creating port-captains for Iloilo, Capiz, Ceb&uacute;, and
Pangasin&aacute;n. Ever since the insurrection of 1744 in Bohol, caused
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>by the imprudence of the Jesuit Morales, the
insurgents had (under their chief Dagohoy) maintained hostilities, not
only against the Spaniards, but even harassing their own countrymen who
occupied the coastal villages of that island. The Recollects, in charge
of the missions of Bohol after the expulsion of the Jesuits, tried to
persuade the rebels to submit to Spanish authority, and secured from
Governor Raon a general amnesty for them; but it resulted only in their
defying further the authority of the government, which was long unable
to take any measures for subduing them. Finally, in 1827, the danger to
the loyal villages of Bohol was so menacing that the authorities were
compelled to protect them and reduce the insurgents; and to this end
Ricafort sent powerful expeditions (May, 1827, and April, 1828), which
after strenuous efforts compelled the rebels to submit.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e718src" href="#xd27e718" name="xd27e718src">19</a>
That governor accomplished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>much during his term of office for
the promotion of agriculture. He ordained (1825 and 1826) that the
native gobernadorcillos should furnish to agriculturists the idle and
unoccupied Indians within their jurisdictions, to work on the estates,
these laborers being paid their daily wages; and on October 30, 1827,
that all complaints in civil cases relating to farm laborers should be
settled by the magistrates as promptly and simply as possible,
&ldquo;observing the contracts and usages of the Indians, when these
are not unjust,&rdquo; and that no Indian laborer should be imprisoned
for a purely civil debt (save those to the royal exchequer), nor should
his animals, tools, lands, or house be seized therefor. The Spanish
minister of the exchequer, Luis L&oacute;pez Ballesteros, also took a
paternal interest in the islands, and secured royal decrees for the
benefit of their industries. One of these (dated April 6, 1828)
encouraged the importation into Filipinas of all machinery suitable for
spinning and weaving cotton, offered public aid to private enterprises
for improvement in weaving and dyeing, and promised protection and
encouragement to all projects for promoting native manufactures of
cloth; and made the exportation of raw cotton from the islands free, in
order to promote the cultivation of that plant. Another decree (of the
same date) permitted the free importation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>of all kinds of
agricultural machinery and implements into Filipinas; and authorized
premiums and rewards from the public funds to Filipino farmers who
should first make large plantations of coffee, cacao, cinnamon, and
cloves, as also to those who should make most progress in the
plantations of Chinese cinnamon [<i lang="es">canel&oacute;n</i>], tea,
and mulberry-trees, and in raising silk, etc. Those who kept in
cultivation a certain area of land, and day-laborers who continued to
work for a certain number of years, were exempted from paying tributes;
and the native farmers were allowed to keep cockpits in operation daily
and without tax, on the estates which they cultivated. &ldquo;In spite
of so many privileges, not many of them were inclined to the
cultivation of their fields.&rdquo; Another royal order (April 6, 1828)
made important regulations regarding the Chinese residing in the
islands; they were to be gathered into villages, as were the Indians;
their heads of barangay were to collect the tributes, as in the Indian
villages, being allowed three per cent of the collections for their
trouble; they were classified into three groups&mdash;those who were
engaged in foreign or wholesale trade, those in domestic or retail
trade, and artisans of all classes&mdash;who were obliged to pay a
monthly tax of ten, four, and two pesos respectively; those who had
settled in the islands, but were not married, must return to China
within six months; and any Chinaman who failed to pay his tax for three
months was to be sent to compulsory labor on some estate, at a
specified wage, from which should be deducted two pesos a month until
his tax dues should be paid.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e731src" href=
"#xd27e731" name="xd27e731src">20</a> Still another royal order of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>the same date gave free permission to any person
of sufficient means to cultivate the opium poppy in Filipinas and
export its product therefrom; and ordered that its culture should begin
on lands close to Manila. Another decree ordained the establishment of
a mint at Manila; but this desirable measure was not carried out until
many years afterward, and the islands meanwhile had to suffer from the
wretched clipped and debased currency which had so long prevailed
there. On October 13, 1828, Ricafort published an edict that all money
which came to the islands coined by the revolted Spanish colonies of
America should be recoined at Manila, taxing it one per cent for this
recoinage. On November 9 following, a long but not destructive
earthquake occurred. In that same year a conspiracy was set on foot by
some civil officials; it was discovered, and its promoters sent to
Spain. As a result, the authorities created a public vigilance
commission, and demanded more troops from Spain; a regiment was
accordingly sent to Manila in 1830. By royal decree of October 27,
1829, it was provided that the post of superintendent of the exchequer
should be filled by the intendant of the army and treasury; accordingly
this charge was assumed (September 9, 1830) by Francisco Enriquez, who
for two years had been intendant succeeding Urr&eacute;jola. In
January, 1829, an officer named Guillermo Galvey <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>(whose
duty it was to follow up smugglers in Pangasin&aacute;n and Ilocos)
conducted an expedition into the district of Benguet; an interesting
account of this is found in the diary left by him. By royal decree of
April 5, 1820 Spanish vessels were permitted to enter British ports
just as British vessels were admitted to Spanish ports. Ricafort,
having finished his government of Filipinas, sailed for Spain at the
end of 1830. He was a governor of good judgment and much energy, and
did much to improve the condition of Manila and of the country. He
issued edicts imposing penalties on those who should sing obscene
songs, and on blasphemers, gamblers, beggars, and parents who brought
up their children in evil ways; and he &ldquo;made provision for a
general domiciliary visitation of Manila and the formation of a list of
its citizens, which measure resulted in many persons of bad antecedents
abandoning the capital. He also decreed standards for weights and
measures, which unfortunately soon fell into disuse; and he created a
military commission with power to execute evildoers, which fulfilled
the object of its creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ricafort was succeeded (December 23, 1830) by Pascual Enrile y
Alcedo, a most zealous and able governor. He personally visited the
northern provinces of Luz&oacute;n, accompanied by his relative and
adjutant, Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Pe&ntilde;aranda (afterward the
governor of Albay), a military engineer, who afterward made journeys
and surveys in a large part of the rest of that island; this resulted
in carefully prepared itineraries, plans, and maps, which were utilized
in the construction of highways and bridges, and the establishment of
postal routes, which opened up communication between regions before
destitute of such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56"
name="pb56">56</a>]</span>facilities, and sometimes in places
heretofore deemed impassable. The navigable rivers and bayous of
Pangasin&aacute;n were explored and mapped; a highway was made in
Pampanga which should be safe from the overflow of Lake Canarem; and
explorations were made from east to west in Luz&oacute;n for the sake
of bringing the shores of the island into communication with the
fertile plains of the interior. On May 14, 1834, Pe&ntilde;aranda was
made corregidor or governor of the province of Albay, &ldquo;which
experienced a complete transformation during his just and beneficent
rule. To him it owed its most important roads, bridges, and public
edifices, and the promotion of its agriculture, on which account his
name is venerated by the inhabitants of Albay; they perpetuated the
memory of this illustrious but modest patriot by erecting, some years
after his death, a monument to him in the plaza of the capital of the
province.&rdquo; The Economic Society of Friends of the Country
contributed to the development of agriculture, in the time of Enrile,
by its reports, memoirs, and material support. We read with surprise,
however, that in 1833 this Society, in an opinion requested from it by
the home government, opposed the establishment of a mint at Manila, and
informed Enrile that such institution was at that time unnecessary. In
March, 1831, Galvey made an expedition into the country of the
Igorrots; and in the following December, to the district of
Bac&uacute;n. A decree of May 9, 1831, established a custom-house in
Zamboanga, &ldquo;in order to prevent the frauds committed by
foreigners in the port of Jol&oacute;, and to facilitate and promote
expeditions to that point.&rdquo; A royal decree of April 24, 1832,
substituted the garrote for the gallows in capital <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>punishments. Another, dated February 16, 1833,
provided for the adjustment and management of the funds belonging to
the obras p&iacute;as, which charge was entrusted later to a committee
composed of the governor of the islands, some of the treasury
officials, and the archbishop.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e746src" href=
"#xd27e746" name="xd27e746src">21</a> The treasury officials, by a
decree <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>of July 3, 1833, accepted the proposal of certain
persons to establish &ldquo;a lottery, at their own account and risk,
offering to pay to the treasury forty per cent [of the receipts?],
besides twenty-five per cent of the value of the tickets which composed
each drawing, after furnishing adequate security as a guarantee for the
fulfilment of their promise.&rdquo; The exclusive privilege of this
lottery was granted to these persons for a period of five years. Enrile
created the <i lang="es">Gu&iacute;a de forasteros</i> [&ldquo;Guide
for Strangers&rdquo;] of Filipinas; it first appeared in 1834. Our
author reproduces (t. ii, pp. 539, 540) the table of contents of this
annual. Fernando VII died on September 29, 1833, and was succeeded by
his daughter Isabel II, to be until her majority under the regency of
her mother, Maria Cristina; this was quickly followed by the Carlist
insurrection, the reactionary party being headed by the young prince
Carlos, who was proclaimed king as Carlos V, and civil war ensued,
which for seven years stained the soil of Spain with the blood of her
own sons. By royal order of August 10, 1834, the Chinese traders were
restricted to the Pari&aacute;n, and those Chinese who were allowed to
reside in the provinces must devote themselves to agricultural
pursuits. Enrile issued an edict on October 1, 1834, removing the
special duties imposed on the Chinese champans, and placing them under
the same regulations as the vessels of other foreign nations. On
February 2, 1835, the official despatches arrived from Spain which
decreed the restoration of the constitutional regime and the
convocation of the Cortes. Enrile strengthened the naval forces sent
against the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>pirates [<i lang="es">la marina sutil</i>,
composed of light-draught vessels], and was able to drive them away
from the coasts of Visayas. He also increased the area planted in
tobacco, enforced just weights and measures, endeavored to correct the
evils resulting from the debased money of the islands, and caused a
light-house to be erected on Corregidor Island. Our writer commends
this governor as being &ldquo;one of the most intelligent and
industrious who have ever ruled Filipinas.&rdquo; &ldquo;To him the
country owes material improvements of the utmost value, of so much
importance as the great highways of Luz&oacute;n, which have
facilitated the intercourse between the provinces, bringing them into
postal communication, one after another, by means of the mail-routes
established by him; and the administration of the colony is indebted to
him for regulations and procedures that are scientific and orderly, in
all the branches that have contributed to the development of the
general welfare, making considerable increase in the public wealth.
Agriculture, commerce, and navigation likewise experienced the
beneficial results of this illustrious governor&rsquo;s judicious
management; and his term of office was the source of the rapid progress
which has been made from that time by these most important factors of
the general welfare&mdash;in great part, thanks to the impulse received
from the measures, dictated by him, which conduced to the natural
development of those industries.&rdquo; Enrile resigned his post, and
returned to Spain early in 1835.</p>
<p>He was succeeded <i lang="la">ad interim</i> (March 1, 1835) by
Gabriel de Torres, at the time the commander of the army [<i lang=
"es">segundo cabo</i>] under Enrile; as a military officer, he
immediately proposed plans for the improvement <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>of the
military service; but these were checked by his premature
death,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e775src" href="#xd27e775" name=
"xd27e775src">22</a> less than two months after entering on his office.
In his place, the command was assumed (April 23) by the officer next
him in rank, Juan Cr&aacute;mer; but he surrendered this office on
September 9 following to the new <span lang="es">segundo cabo</span>,
Pedro Antonio Salazar Castillo y Varona. The latter, on April 25, 1836,
issued an edict that &ldquo;the plain [<i lang="es">sencillas</i>]
pesetas coined in the Peninsula should be accepted [in the islands] at
their lawful value of four reals vell&oacute;n instead of five, as if
they were pillar coins [<i lang="es">columnarias</i>];<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e788src" href="#xd27e788" name="xd27e788src">23</a>
accordingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>they began to circulate, having been recently
introduced into the islands.&rdquo; On June 11, 1836, the
superintendency of treasury affairs was assumed by Urr&eacute;jola in
place of Enr&iacute;quez.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e807src" href=
"#xd27e807" name="xd27e807src">24</a> On July 28, Salazar found it
necessary to issue an edict for the enforcement of the laws which
prohibited carrying gunpowder and firearms to the Indias, and selling
them in countries hostile to Spain; this referred especially to
Moroland, where evidently the pirates had been thus aided by
unscrupulous traders to make their raids against the northern islands.
Salazar thought that he could restrain those piracies by carrying on
commerce with the Moros, and therefore made a treaty with the sultan of
Jol&oacute;, Mahamad Diamalud Quiram (September 22, 1836), which
stipulated &ldquo;that every three-masted ship which made port at
Jol&oacute; with Chinese passengers from Manila should pay 2,000 pesos
fuertes, and smaller vessels in proportion to their size;&rdquo; but
&ldquo;the most important cargo which went from Manila to Jol&oacute;
never exceeded 2,500 pesos. The Joloan barks which should go to
Zamboanga were to pay a duty of one per cent, and those which entered
at Manila two per cent; but no Joloan bark was accustomed to go to
Manila.&rdquo; The governor of Zamboanga also made a treaty with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>another Moro ruler; but it resulted only in
increasing the insolence of the pirates, who paid no attention to their
treaties. At the beginning of 1836, Salazar sent an expedition under
Galvey to occupy the Igorrot country; but it was, despite
Galvey&rsquo;s remonstrances, sent in too great haste, and without
adequate preparations, and too near the beginning of the rainy season;
they reached that region, and built some forts, but so many of the
soldiers were attacked by sickness that the expedition was forced to
give up the undertaking and retire, &ldquo;without any other result
than the expenditure of several thousand dollars.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e813src" href="#xd27e813" name="xd27e813src">25</a>
In that same year, Pe&ntilde;aranda conducted with brilliant success an
expedition to dislodge the pirates from Masbate Island, where they had
fortified themselves. &ldquo;Afterward, he established a system of
signals in the provinces of the south, to watch the movements of those
pirates.&rdquo; On January 26, 1837, Salazar sent an urgent request to
the Spanish government for the despatch of Spanish regulars to supply
the parish curacies throughout the archipelago, as (for the same
reasons advanced by former governors) he considered the Indian clerics
unfit for that purpose. In view of the secularization of the orders
that had been decreed in Spain,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e816src"
href="#xd27e816" name="xd27e816src">26</a> he desired that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>some two
hundred of the friars there should be sent to Filipinas, which, added
to those already in the islands, would be sufficient for the parishes.
The political disturbances in Spain found some reflection in the
distant colonies; and in February, 1837, there was danger of a tumult
arising, &ldquo;some insisting that the Constitution should be
proclaimed, in order that they might utilize the change to their own
advantage;&rdquo; among these were several officers of high rank.
Absurd reports were circulated throughout Manila: that the governor was
opposed to the proclamation, and was intending to banish certain
persons from the country, and that he was a Carlist, etc. Violent
measures were proposed by some of the radicals, but these were resisted
by some of the cooler heads; and many citizens opposed the proclamation
of the Constitution, fearing that serious disturbances would result.
Salazar, being informed of these things, promised that when the royal
despatches arrived he would open them in the presence of all, and
fulfil whatever orders he should receive from the home government. This
occurred on August 26 of that year, and the royal orders decreed that
no change in political affairs should be made in Filipinas until the
Cortes should decide the matter; this and Salazar&rsquo;s tact
reconciled the contending factions. At the same time he received a
decree reducing in all departments the military forces of the islands;
the authorities resolved to suspend the execution of this order, and
sent an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>envoy to remonstrate with the government on this
subject&mdash;for this purpose choosing one of the officers who had
been most prominent in the recent controversy, and thus removing from
Manila a person whose presence there was regarded as dangerous. By
royal order of February 1, 1836 (published in the islands on March 31,
1837), order was given that there should be compiled and published in
Manila every year tables of the values of the moneys from the new
provinces of America, in order that their value might, in their
circulation in Manila, be properly adjusted to the Spanish peso;
consequently, the recoinage of American money was stopped. A later
edict ordered that from June 1, 1837, &ldquo;the coin called cuarto
should circulate at the rate of twenty to the real,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e828src" href="#xd27e828" name="xd27e828src">27</a> instead of
seventeen as hitherto, on account of the greater size and weight of the
new coins; and to this new subdivision were adjusted the prices of the
measures of tobacco established therefor, and the revenues from wine.
Also the circulation of cigars [<i>tabacos</i>] in place of money was
forbidden; the Indians had introduced this on account of the scarcity
of copper coin, and because the greater part of that then current was
counterfeit, on which account a multitude of disputes had arisen. The
governor decided, moreover, that the Spanish peseta should be accepted
at thirty-two cuartos, five [pesetas], therefore, corresponding to the
peso fuerte.&rdquo; A royal order of May 31, 1837, declared certain
jurisdictions&mdash;Caraga, Samar, Iloilo, Antique, Capis, Albay,
Camarines Sur, and Tayabas&mdash;to be those of governors, at once
military and political, who should be military <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>officers
appointed by the War Department; all the rest (excepting Cavite,
Zamboanga, and the Marianas, which also were filled like the foregoing)
were classed as alcaldeships, and appointments thereto should be made
from the attorney-general&rsquo;s office [<i lang="es">Ministerio de
Gracia y Justicia</i>]. The Constitution of 1837 was decreed and
sanctioned by the Cortes on June 8 of that year; and it was ordained by
that body that the provinces of Ultramar should be governed by special
laws, a provision reiterated by succeeding constitutions. &ldquo;From
that time Filipinas lost its representation in the Cortes.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>On August 4, 1837, arrived at Manila the new governor of the
islands, Andr&eacute;s Garc&iacute;a Camba, a knight of the Order of
Santiago. He had already spent ten years in Filipinas (April, 1825, to
March, 1835), and had gone to Spain as the deputy of Manila to the
Cortes, an honor twice again conferred upon him. He was received with
the utmost enthusiasm, although the Liberals at Manila were irritated
by the action of the Cortes in depriving the islands of representation
therein; but Camba himself had liberal views, as well as a generous and
kindly nature, and gained the good-will of that party. This made
trouble for him, however, in another direction. The civil war in Spain
aroused there great partisan bitterness, which spread to the colonies;
and in Filipinas was a Carlist and reactionary faction, who opposed
Camba in every way. &ldquo;The regular clergy, as a body, were
partisans of the Pretender, and not only gave him their sympathy but
aided him, as well as the Carlist publications, with their money. The
court of Madrid was aware of this attitude of the friars, and had
already sharply censured Salazar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>for his indulgence and lenity
toward them. Several Carlist partisans had been banished from Spain to
the Marianas, but had gone to Manila instead, and were not only
unmolested there, but visited and entertained by many of the most
prominent people of the city, and especially by the ecclesiastical
element. Camba found that Carlist reunions were being held in the
convents of San Juan de Dios and Santo Domingo, and that even the
archbishop, [Fray Jos&eacute; Segui] was an avowed adherent of the
Pretender; the governor tried to conciliate the disaffected, but with
little success, since the clergy, the Audiencia, and many influential
persons, both citizens and officials, were jealous and hostile toward
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e860src" href="#xd27e860" name=
"xd27e860src">28</a> He was obliged to compel the archbishop to deposit
certain funds, belonging to the Cavite hospital, in the royal treasury,
instead of the Dominican convent; also to arrest a Dominican friar for
conducting treasonable correspondence with Carlists, and to send to
Spain a military officer concerned therein. Notwithstanding
Camba&rsquo;s ability, integrity, and devotion to the interests of the
islands, and his patience with his opponents, they exerted so much
influence and carried on so many intrigues against him, not only in
Manila but at Madrid, that they procured his recall to Spain;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e863src" href="#xd27e863" name="xd27e863src">29</a>
and on December 29, 1838, he surrendered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

successor, Luis Lardiz&aacute;bal y Montoya. Notwithstanding the
obstacles and difficulties which Camba continually encountered, he
accomplished some important improvements in the
administration,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e870src" href="#xd27e870"
name="xd27e870src">30</a> the chief of these being the reorganization
of the postal service, which from 1838 was conducted under one bureau
and on modern lines; he improved the means of communication between the
provinces, and pushed forward the reduction of the heathen tribes. He
informed the Spanish government that the attempts to make treaties and
alliances with the sultans of Jol&oacute; were of no use in bringing
any permanent or substantial advantage to Spanish navigation and
commerce. In 1837 was published the <i lang="es">Flora de Filipinas</i>
of the Augustinian Fray Manuel Blanco, the first attempt to form a
compendium of Philippine botany.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e877src"

"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>of
October 24, 1838, &ldquo;created in Spain a consulting committee for
the administration of colonial affairs, as members of the same being
appointed, among others, the ex-governors of Filipinas Ricafort and
Enrile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A royal order of November 16, 1838, had prohibited the holding of
provincial chapter-sessions in Filipinas; the Recollect procurator at
Madrid remonstrated with the government against this, and the matter
was referred to the governor and archbishop of Manila.
Lardiz&aacute;bal decided that the chapters should meet, and that the
senior auditor of the Audiencia should attend those sessions, as the
representative of the vice-regal patron. By a decree of August 31, the
governor regulated the status of the Chinese in the islands. They were
&ldquo;classified as transients, those spending the winter [in the
islands], and permanent residents. They were allowed to choose the
occupation which best suited them, without any restriction. The
resident Chinese who should be arrested [as being] without official
permit [<i lang="es">c&eacute;dula</i>] or passport were condemned to
labor on the public works; and deportation to Zamboanga, Misamis,
Paragua, and Calamianes was decreed for all those who were serving a
prison term for failure to pay their capitation-tax, in both Manila and
Cavite, with the object of securing by this means a larger population
for those places.&rdquo; On July 6, 1839, a weekly publication was
begun in Manila entitled, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=
"#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span><i lang="es">Precios corrientes de
Manila</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Prices current at
Manila&rdquo;],<a class="noteref" id="xd27e902src" href="#xd27e902"
name="xd27e902src">32</a> in the Spanish and English languages. A royal
decree of October 4, 1839, provided for the introduction and
circulation of books in the islands; the fiscal must designate those
that merited examination, and then they must be passed upon by two
censors, appointed by the governor and the archbishop respectively,
whose opinion must be submitted to the fiscal; and if &ldquo;there
shall appear sufficient ground for prohibiting the circulation of any
work, because it may contain principles, opinions, or doctrines opposed
to the rights of the legitimate government or to the religion of the
State, it shall be not only seized but reshipped.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e911src" href="#xd27e911" name="xd27e911src">33</a>
On July 15, 1840, was opened the School of Commerce, established at the
request of the Board [<i lang="es">Junta</i>] of Commerce. &ldquo;On
November 11 Lardiz&aacute;bal repeated Ricafort&rsquo;s edict of 1828,
prohibiting foreigners from selling merchandise at retail and entering
the provinces to trade.&rdquo; At the end of this year important
changes were made in the administration of financial affairs, all the
revenues arising from government monopolies being united under one
bureau; and another bureau was likewise created for the general
administration of the tributes and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72"
href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>some other branches of revenue,
as those from cockpits, tithes, etc.; while in all the general offices
of supervision was introduced the system of bookkeeping by double
entry, which had been established in the royal accountancy of the
exchequer in 1839. The governor also issued instructions for more
careful and accurate accounting being made of municipal property and
local imposts, in order to prevent abuses and waste of funds.
Lardiz&aacute;bal was soon weary of his command, although faithful to
his duties while governor, and so earnestly entreated the home
government to allow him to return to Spain that finally he gained this
permission; and he departed on that voyage (February, 1841), only to
die a few days after leaving Manila; he was buried on an islet near
Java. He was succeeded by Marcelino de Or&aacute;a Lecumberri.

&ldquo;Originally, when the port of the capital of Filipinas was
visited only by vessels from the Asiatic nations and a few Spanish
ships, the exaction of duties was in the hands of the royal officials,
according to the laws of the Indias. In 1779 Basco y Vargas ordained
that those functionaries should attend only to collecting duties from
the ships which navigated to the coasts of Coromandel, Malabar,
Bengala, Java, Cant&oacute;n, Acapulco, and C&aacute;diz; and that the
duties proper to the entrance or outgo of products and commodities in
the inter-island commerce should be in charge of the director of
alcabala. From this originated the foundation of the custom-house, it
being completed by royal decrees of 1786 and 1788, from which time it
was provided with the necessary force of men for collecting the import
and export duties.&rdquo; (Note by Montero y Vidal.)&nbsp;<a class=

they have honored their author, and laboured to avert his chastisement.
Several in low circumstances will club to buy a Bisayan Christian
slave, or any one that is to be sold cheap; that all may partake the
benefit of the execution. So at Kalagan, on Mindano, as Rajah Moodo
informed me, when the god of the mountain gives no brimstone, they
sacrifice some old slave, to appease the wrath of the deity. Some also
believe, those they kill in this world, are to serve them in the next,

&ldquo;perhaps five or six Kangans&rdquo; for an old slave, and that
the above mountain is &ldquo;in the district of Kalagan [<i>i.e.</i>,

interesting account of this event is furnished in a letter by Peter
Dobell, then Russian consul in the Philippines, which is preserved in
the New York Public Library; it is printed in the <i lang=
"es">Bulletin</i> of that institution for June, 1903, at pp.
198&ndash;200. Dobell went to Macao for medical treatment in July,
1820, and this letter was written from that city, on November 28 of
that year. He thus writes: &ldquo;I arrived with my wife and daughter
at Manilla last March, was received with great apparent attention,
politeness &amp; hospitality. After living there a couple of months,
however, I perceived that there existed a vast deal of jealousy and
envy, against all strangers, and particularly those who resided or
intended to form establishments in the country. Those ignorant people
could not divest themselves of this feeling, even toward those, whose
capitals, talents and industry, were directed to the most laudable
pursuits, and promised to produce great public as well as private
advantages to the colony. At this crisis several french ships were in
the port, one or two Americans and a English ship from Bengal. In the
French ships, had arrived a naturalist sent out by the government to
make collections, and some persons, who intended to remain in the
Philippines to cultivate sugar, cotton &amp;c<span class="corr" id=
"xd27e551" title="Not in source">.</span> &amp;c. In the month of July
last, I discovered that I had in my travels, contracted a disease,
called by the Doct<sup>r</sup> Hydrocele and becoming very troublesome
to me, I determined as there are no good surgeons in Manilla to pay a
short visit to Macao with my family &amp; return to my post, as soon as
circumstances <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41n" href="#pb41n" name=
"pb41n">41</a>]</span>would permit, after the operation. This I found,
I could do the more conveniently, as my Nephew, a fine young Man of 23
years, had joined me at my arrival and I left him, in full charge of my
office &amp;c and departed. This envious disposition, on the part of
the Spaniards, increased daily, against the Strangers, until an
opportunity presented itself of gratifying their malignant hatred, in
the most cruel &amp; bloody manner &amp; without themselves appearing
to have any thing to do in the business. It is necessary first to tell
you, that the new constitution, had been received during the prevalence
of this feeling, giving extensive privileges &amp; liberal
encouragement to foreigners, who might think proper to settle in the
Philippines &amp; rendering the natives as free &amp; equal, in rights,
etc<span class="corr" id="xd27e559" title="Not in source">.</span> as
their former masters. This certainly made them<a id="xd27e563" name=
"xd27e563"></a> a little unruly, but, if not secretly instigated, it
would never have induced them to commit a crime, that makes humanity
shudder. The ship from Bengal, was the Merope Captain Nichols and it
was supposed she had bro<sup>t</sup> into the colony the epidemic, that
has ravaged all India, this year, under the name of the &lsquo;Cholera
Morbus.&rsquo; It made its appearance, in the beginning of October
last, carrying off great numbers of the Indians every day. The humane
French &amp; other Strangers, who beheld these miserable wretches,
dying around them without any medical aid, freely administered what
medicines they had, and were actively &amp; daily employed, in
endeavoring to alleviate; the distress &amp; cure the complaints of all
those, who lived within the sphere of their exertions. This also
became, a cause of jealousy and hatred and the villains, began
immediately to exasperate the Indians by saying, &lsquo;this poisonous
disease, was introduced by the French &amp; the other strangers, they
have poisoned even the waters, and they administer poison to the sick,
purposely to exterpate the whole race of Tagalians.&rsquo; The
ferocious Indians wanted nothing farther to excite them to deeds of
blood &amp; plunder. On the 9<sup>th</sup> of October about 10 or 11 in
the morning they collected, to the number of about 3,000 Men armed with
pikes knives and bludgeons and proceeded coolly and deliberately to
plunder and Massacre all the Strangers on whom they could lay their
hands! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42n" href="#pb42n" name=
"pb42n">42</a>]</span>I have not time to give you the details of this
shocking business, but you will certainly read them in the gazettes as
I have sent both to England and Russia very full accounts for
publication. Suffice it now to say that the Governor &amp; the
authorities were vainly implored for assistance. They came, it is true,
with the troops, but it was only to behold with sang froid the horrid
spectacle. Not a musket was fired to save the lives of those
unfortunate and defenceless strangers, who to the number of 39 were
plundered &amp; cruelly massacred; some of them were so cut up &amp;
mangled it was impossible to recognize them. As the most of them were
Roman Catholics, they were all collected and thrown into a hole
together without the shadow of a ceremony or a stone to mark their
graves! What is worse, the last accts from there down to the
9<sup>th</sup> of November mention that not a spanish life was lost,
nor has a single native as yet suffered punishment for this most
atrocious &amp; horrible deed. My house was attacked &amp; pillaged, my
Nephew &amp; a Mr Prince of Boston, who lived with him, made
prisonners, and, after being near two days in the hands of the Indians,
suffering the most abominable treatment, they luckily escaped Death.
Eighty five Chinese &amp; 11 English seamen were also plundered &amp;
assassinated. I have been obliged to represent this affair in its full
suit of <i>Black</i> to my Government and have at the same time
declared my intention of going back to Siberia, next April, where I
shall await the orders of His Imperial Majesty&#8202;&hellip;. I leave
the place &amp; those miscreants to themselves, from the conviction,
that its commerce is ruined forever. In the first place they held their
productions <span class="corr" id="xd27e589" title=
"Source: two">too</span> high &amp; paid too low for European
commodities, so that, when the allowance of the half duties granted to
the importers of sugars shall cease, no french ships will visit the
Philippines to pay from 7 to 9 Dollars a pecul for Sugars. The Cadmus,
you say will make money. If she does, she will I fancy be the only
American ship that profits by its trade to Manilla. All those, who came
out last year lost money on the sales of their cargoes, &amp;, from
what we hear of prices in America, and on the Continent, they must lose
by the returns. But what will give the death blow to the prosperity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43n" href="#pb43n" name=
"pb43n">43</a>]</span>of the Philippines, is the late horrible
massacre. All those french and other foreigners, who were anxious to
have established themselves in commerce or on estates in the country,
are now frightened off and certainly no one will find himself,
confident enough to trust to a Government, which could permit such a
massacre to take place, immediately under its eyes, when it had 5,000
men in arms, ready at a minutes notice to disperse the Mob. Thus
situated, Manilla offers no chance of profit or Speculation; and I
confess, however my hopes and wishes may have been disappointed, I turn
from them with disgust &amp; horror, better pleased to be ordered to
live, in some remote corner of Siberia, on black bread &amp; salt, than
roll in wealth, amidst such an inhuman, illiberal and unchristianlike
race of Men&#8202;&hellip;. I must close my letter by informing you
that the Captain General has refused all the applications for
indemnification, from those who have been plundered; so that as yet,
neither the punishment due to the assassins has been inflicted, nor
redress made to the unfortunate people who were robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">By the kindness of James A. LeRoy, the Editors
have in their hands a copy (furnished by Dr. Pardo de Tavera from the
original in his possession) of a decree issued by Governor Folgueras
(dated at Manila, October 20, 1820), addressed &ldquo;to the natives of
the Filipinas Islands, and especially to those of the district of
Tondo,&rdquo; in which he rebukes them severely for thus violating the
law of nations, under the influence of &ldquo;a general frenzy,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;led astray and infuriated by certain malicious
persons.&rdquo; He characterizes their belief that the strangers had
poisoned the waters as a foolish and absurd notion, which &ldquo;the
mountain Negritos or the Moros of Jol&oacute; and Mindanao would be
ashamed to entertain;&rdquo; and reminds them that the strangers whom
they have plundered and slain were not only friends and brethren, but
the very persons on whom the prosperity of the islands must depend,
since they supplied a market for the produce of the country. He then
presents the report which has been made by an official whom the
governor had specially appointed (October 13) to investigate this idea
of the foreigners&rsquo; crime, which is to the following effect:
&ldquo;As <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44n" href="#pb44n" name=
"pb44n">44</a>]</span>the evidence of guilt [<i lang="es">cuerpo de
delito</i>, the same as the Latin <i lang="la">corpus delicti</i>] in
the poisoning which is charged, the Indians have brought to us, among
the spoils which they plundered from the houses of the Frenchmen,
various animals of different forms, and among them a serpent, of quite
the usual size, one of those which they call
&lsquo;house-snakes,&rsquo; in a dissected state; others, with some
little shellfish, preserved in spirits of wine, in a crystal flask; in
another, two granos of muriatic baryte; a quantity of Peruvian bark,
which in my opinion would weigh about an arroba and a half; and a box
of sheet-tin about a vara long, one-fourth as wide, and six dedos
thick, in which also was found a mass of insects, but already decaying;
and finally, in the house of a woman who had been accused of being an
agent of the French for the alleged poisoning, a little package of some
black powders in China paper [<i>i.e.</i>, rice paper].&rdquo; The
official states that these animal specimens have evidently &ldquo;no
other object than to enrich cabinets of natural history,&rdquo; and
could not in any way have been used for injuring human beings. The
muriatic baryte was for use in analyzing mineral waters, and was,
moreover, useful in various diseases. The Peruvian bark was, as all
might know, a useful medicine and had often been helpful in checking
the cholera itself. The black powders, it was also decided, were also
of medicinal value; and the entire story is characterized as a fiction
and delusion. The official regrets that it was believed by so many
persons who should have known better than to accept so gross an error;
&ldquo;but it is certain that they did, and, among them, many of the
clergy; and with this the delusion attained such power that it has
caused the very scandalous deeds which all good persons lament; for it
is certain that there is no better way of propagating an error than for
persons of authority to adopt it. There is no doubt, it appears, that
this foolish idea of poisoning had its origin in the ignorance of the
Indians; but there is as little doubt that malicious persons, imposing
upon this folly and lack of knowledge in the Indians, incited them to
perpetrate the assassinations and robberies of the disastrous days,
October 9 and 10.&rdquo; He adds that one of the books brought to him
by the Indians, which they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45n" href=
"#pb45n" name="pb45n">45</a>]</span>had taken from the house of the
French naturalist, was filled with sketches of fishes, mollusks, and
birds peculiar to the country, which plainly showed that he was only
making zoological observations. In view of all these things, Folgueras
calls upon the natives to repent of their sin, to surrender to the
authorities the instigators of the tumult, to restore to the plundered
foreigners what had been stolen from them, and to denounce the authors
of the murders, that justice might be done to these evil persons. These
exhortations are especially addressed to the inhabitants of Binondo,
&ldquo;which has been the theatre of the most horrible tragedy, and has
covered itself with blood and ignominy.&rdquo; This decree is published

Ricafort published a relation of this enterprise, dated at Manila,
December 30, 1829; he describes the island, presents an historical
sketch of the insurrection in Bohol since 1744 and the efforts to quell
it, and at the end furnishes a tabulated statement of the expeditions
sent by his orders, with number of men, expenditures, etc., and of
their results&mdash;a statement signed by Captain Manuel Sanz, the
leader of the expedition, and dated at Talibon, August 31, 1829; to
this is added the signed statement by the parish curas of Bohol that
the numbers of insurgents who have been conquered or have submitted to
the Spanish rule agree with their respective registers. According to
this account, the number of insurgents reduced or submitted was 19,420;
to this must be added 98 &ldquo;banished for their rebellious
dispositions,&rdquo; and 395 &ldquo;obstinate persons who died at the
hands of the troops,&rdquo; and an unknown (&ldquo;for lack of
information&rdquo;) number of those killed in the year 1827 and on
March 28 of 1828, and more than 3,000 souls who have fled to other
provinces. Some of the troops were Spaniards from Manila, but the main
part of the force was composed of Indians from Bohol and Ceb&uacute;,
to the number of 5,970 and 54 respectively; 294 of the former and 32 of
the latter deserted the ranks, and 4,977 Boholans and 22 Cebuans were
at the end disbanded, as being on the sick list; and very few were
either killed or wounded in the campaign. The reduced insurgents were
formed into the following new villages: Catigbian, with 1,967 souls;
Batuanan, with 6,266 souls; Cabulao, with 790; Balilijan, with 2,100;
and Vilar, with 930. In other villages were distributed the remaining
insurgents.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e718src">&uarr;</a></p>

Chinese refused to accept their reduction into villages; more than
eight hundred elected to return to their own country; four hundred odd
were assigned to labor on the public works, as being insolvent; and
about a thousand fled to the mountains in order to elude payment and
punishment. The intendant, in view of the difficulty in collecting
[their] taxes, explained to the government the expediency of modifying
the enactment; and this was done in 1834.&rdquo; (Note by Montero y

funds were chiefly the obras p&iacute;as which had been administered by
the Jesuit order in Filipinas up to their expulsion from the islands;
at that time, nearly half of these foundations were extinguished by the
authorities, and such moneys as remained in them were covered into the
royal treasury. Forty-five of the Jesuit obras p&iacute;as were thus
left, which were administered by the government in the following
manner: The capital was divided (as had long been the custom of all the
orders in Filipinas in administering obras p&iacute;as) into three
parts; one of these was invested in the commerce of Acapulco, another
in that of the Coromandel Coast and China, and the other third remained
on deposit as a reserve to make good any losses in the amounts
invested. Much light is thrown on the management of these funds by the
Jesuits, in the official report made (June 23, 1797), in pursuit of a
command from the Spanish government, by Angel de la Fuente, the chief
of the Bureau of Secular Revenues [<i lang="es">Contadur&iacute;a de
Temporalidades</i>] at Manila; the original MS. of this is in the
possession of Edward K. Ayer, Chicago. Fuente examined the
account-books which the Jesuits had kept of these funds, and found them
full of confusion, discrepancies, and omissions; but after comparing
and verifying them so far as he could, he made a list of them, with
statement of their origin, amount, and application. He found that in
seventeen of these funds there was no evidence that the money had been
applied as directed by the donors, and only partial indications of this
in fifteen others. He reported that many of these obras p&iacute;as had
been contributed for the advantage and benefit of the Jesuits
themselves, and therefore, since that order had been suppressed, the
funds might now justly be applied to any desirable pious purpose. To
this end, he recommended that nineteen of the funds be placed in charge
of the diocesan authorities, and twelve others used by the government
for specified purposes, and that the rest be covered into the royal
treasury.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e746src">&uarr;</a></p>

&ldquo;pillar dollar&rdquo; was so called from the pillars on the
reverse of the coin, which represent the pillars of Hercules, or the
Straits of Gibraltar; this device was characteristic of the
Spanish-American coinage. This dollar was the <i lang="es">peso
duro</i> (or &ldquo;hard dollar&rdquo;), of eight reals; and its half,
quarter, eighth, sixteenth, and thirty-second parts were represented by
smaller coins. The greater part of the supply of pillar dollars were
made in Mexico; but this coinage ceased in 1822. In the Peninsula, the
coins were the dollar&mdash;formerly of ten reals, but now of twenty
reals vell&oacute;n&mdash;the half, the peseta or pistareen (which is
one-fifth of the dollar, or four reals vell&oacute;n), and the half and
the quarter pistareen. After the Peninsular revolution of 1821, pillar
dollars were struck for a short time at Madrid, but these are easily
distinguishable from the true pillar dollar. In 1810&ndash;16, silver
coins were used in Brazil, which were only the Spanish dollar, softened
by annealing, and then restamped; the pillars may be distinguished
underneath this surface, by close inspection. See Eckfeldt and DuBois,
<i>Manual of Gold and Silver Coins</i> (Philadelphia, 1842), pp. 33,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the numerous groupes of islands which constitute
the maritime division of Asia, the Phillippines, in situation, riches,
fertility, and salubrity, are equal or superior to any. Nature has here
revelled in all that poets or painters have thought or dreamt of
unbounded luxuriance of Asiatic scenery. The lofty chains of
mountains&mdash;the rich and extensive slopes which form their
bases&mdash;the ever-varying change of forest and savannah&mdash;of
rivers and lakes&mdash;the yet blazing volcanoes in the midst of
forests, coeval perhaps with their first eruption&mdash;all stamp her
work with the mighty emblems of her creative and destroying powers.
Java alone can compete with them in fertility; but in riches, extent,
situation, and political importance, it is far inferior.</p>
<p>Their position, whether in a political or commercial point of view,
is strikingly advantageous. With India and the Malay Archipelago on the
west and south, the islands of the fertile Pacific and the rising
empires of the new world on the east, the vast market of China at their
doors, their insular position and numerous rivers affording a facility
of communication and defence to every part of them, an active and
industrious population, climates of almost all varieties, a soil so
fertile in vegetable and mineral productions as almost to exceed
credibility; the Phillippine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=
"#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>Islands alone, in the hands of an
industrious and commercial nation, and with a free and enlightened
government, would have become a mighty empire:&mdash;they are&mdash;a
waste!</p>
<p>This archipelago presents, in common with all the islands which form
the southern and eastern barrier of Asia, those striking features which
mark a recent or an approaching convulsion of nature: they are
separated by narrow, but deep, and frequently unfathomable channels;
their steep and often tremendous capes and headlands, though clothed
with verdure to the very brink, appear to rise almost perpendicularly
from the ocean; they have but few reefs or shoals, and those of small
extent; and in the interior of the islands, numerous volcanoes, in
activity or very recently so, boiling springs and mineral waters of all
descriptions, minerals of all kinds on the very surface of the earth,
and frequent shocks of earthquakes, all point to this conclusion, and
offer a rich and unexplored field to the geologist<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e969src" href="#xd27e969" name="xd27e969src">2</a> and
mineralogist, as do their plants and animals to the botanist and
zoologist;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e977src" href="#xd27e977" name=
"xd27e977src">3</a> the few attempts that have hitherto been made to
examine them, having from various causes failed, or only extended to a
short distance round the capital.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e982src"

"pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>The climate of these islands is remarkably temperate and salubrious.
The thermometer in Manila is sometimes as low as 70&deg;, and rarely
exceeds 90&deg; in the house during the N. E. monsoon. In the interior
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>it is sometimes as low as 68&deg; in the mornings,
which are remarkably cool, so much so as to require at time$ woolen
clothing. None of the mountains are within the limits of perpetual
congelation; but I think some cannot be far from it, as I have seen
something much resembling snow on the Pico de Mindoro, and there may be
higher ones in the interior of Magindanao.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1012src" href="#xd27e1012" name="xd27e1012src">6</a></p>
<p>Both natives and Spaniards live to a tolerable age, in spite of the
indolent habits of the latter, and the debauches of both. The Spaniards
are most commonly carried off by chronic dysentery, which is called by
them &ldquo;<span lang="es">la enfermed&aacute;d del pays</span>&rdquo;
(the illness of the country): from its very frequent occurrence, at
least 7 out of 10 of those who exceed the age of 40, fall victims to
this disorder.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1025src" href="#xd27e1025"
name="xd27e1025src">7</a> Acute <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"
href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>liver complaints are very rare,
as is also the chronic affection of that organ, unless as connected
with the preceding disorder.</p>
<p>Fevers are not common amongst Europeans, <i>in Manila</i>. Amongst
the natives, the intermittent is of common occurrence, particularly
after the rains (in September and October), and in woody or marshy
situations.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1042src" href="#xd27e1042" name=
"xd27e1042src">8</a> This appears to be owing as much to the thinness
and want of clothing, together with their habits of bathing
indiscriminately at all hours, as to miasmata; and, as their fevers are
generally neglected, they often superinduce other and more fatal
disorders, as obstructions, &amp;c. Tetanos in cases of wounds is of
common occurrence, and generally fatal.</p>
<p>Their population, by a census taken in 1817&ndash;18, amounted to
2,236,000 souls, and is increasing rapidly. In one province, that of
Pampanga, from 1817 to 1818, there was an increase of 6,737 souls, the
whole population being in 1817, 22,500; but I suspect some inaccuracy
in this. The total increase from 1797 to 1817, 25 [<i>sic</i>] years,
is by this statement 835,500, or 3,360 per annum! In this census are
included only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>those subject to Spanish laws. About three
quarters of a million more may be added for the various independent
tribes,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1057src" href="#xd27e1057" name=
"xd27e1057src">9</a> which may be said to possess the whole of the
interior of the islands, on some of which, as the large one of Mindanao
(called by the natives Magindanao) there are only a few contemptible
[Spanish] posts, the interior and a great part of the coast being still
subject to the Malay sultans, originally of Arab race.</p>
<p>The population of the Marianas and Calamianes Islands, with that of
Palawan, which are all included in &ldquo;The Kingdom of the
Phillippines,&rdquo; are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href=
"#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>comprised in this number, but the
whole of these does not exceed 19,000.</p>
<p>Of this number about 600 only are <i>European</i> Spaniards, with
some few foreigners: the remainder are divided into various classes, of
which the principal are, 1st, The Negroes, or aborigines; 2d, the
Malays (or Indians, as they are called by the Spaniards); and the
Mestizos and Creoles, who are about as 1 to 5 of the Indian
population.</p>
<p>The Negroes [<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Negritos</i>]<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1080src" href="#xd27e1080" name="xd27e1080src">10</a> are in all
probability the original inhabitants of these islands, as they appear
at some remote epoch to have been of almost all the eastern
archipelago. The tide of Malay emigration, from whatever cause and part
it proceeded, has on some islands entirely destroyed them. Others, as
New Guinea, it has not yet reached, a circumstance which seems to point
to the west as the original cradle of the Malay race. In the
Phillippines, it has driven them from the coast to the mountains, which
by augmenting the difficulty of procuring subsistence, may have much
diminished their numbers. Still, however, they form a distinct, and
perhaps a more numerous class of men than is generally suspected. They
have in the present day undisturbed possession of nearly &#8532;ds of
the island of Luzon, and of others a still larger proportion.</p>
<p>These people are small in stature, some of them almost dwarfish,
woolly-headed, and thick-lipped, like the negroes of Africa, to whom
indeed they bear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>a striking resemblance, though the different
tribes vary much in their stature and general appearance. They subsist
entirely on the chase, or on fruits, herbs, roots, or fish when they
can approach the coast. They are nearly, and often quite naked, and
live in huts formed of the boughs of trees, grass &amp;c., or in the
trees themselves, when on an excursion or migration. Their mode of life
is wandering and unsettled, seldom remaining long enough in one place
to form a village. They sometimes sow a little maize or rice, and wait
its ripening, but not longer. These are the habits of the tribes which
border on the Spanish settlements. Farther within the mountains they
are more settled, and even form villages of considerable size, in the
deep vallies by which the chains of mountains are intersected. The
entrances to these they fortify with plantations of the thorny bamboo,
pickets of the same, set strongly in the earth and sharpened by fire,
ditches and pit-falls; in short all the means of defence in their power
are employed to render these places inaccessible. Here they cultivate
corn, rice, and tobacco; the last they sell to Indians, who smuggle it
into the towns. This being a contraband article, as it is monopolized
by government, the defences are used against the Spanish revenue
officers and troops, who on this account never fail to destroy their
establishments when they can do so, though many are impregnable to any
force they can bring against them, from the nature of the passes, and
from the activity of the negroes, who use their bows with wonderful
expertness. There are indeed instances of their repulsing bodies of one
or two hundred native troops, but affairs of this magnitude are very
rare.</p>
<p>To this predatory kind of warfare, as well as to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>the
defective qualities, and often very reprehensible conduct of the
missionaries, generally Indian priests (<i lang="es">Clerigos</i>), are
perhaps to be in some measure attributed their unsettled habits. Those
nearest the Spanish settlements carry on a little commerce, receiving
wrought iron, cloth, and tobacco, but oftener <i>dollars</i>, in
exchange for gold-dust, &amp;c., or for wax, honey, and other products
of their mountains. The circumstance of their receiving dollars, which
they rarely use in their purchases, is a curious one; but it is a fact,
and very large quantities of money are supposed to be thus buried; from
what motive, except a superstitious one, cannot be imagined.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1111src" href="#xd27e1111" name=
"xd27e1111src">11</a></p>
<p>Of their manners or customs little or nothing is known. Like all
savage nations, they are abundantly tinctured with superstitions,
fickle, and hasty. One of their customs best known is, that upon the
death of a chief, they plant themselves in ambush on some frequented
track, and with their arrows assassinate the first unfortunate
traveller who passes, and not unfrequently two or three; the bodies are
carried off as sacrifices to the manes of the deceased.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1119src" href="#xd27e1119" name=
"xd27e1119src">12</a> The communications between the Spanish
settlements are often interrupted by this circumstance, as no Indian
will venture out when the negroes are known to be &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">de luto</span>&rdquo; (in mourning): they are also <i>said</i> to
have a &ldquo;throwing of spears,&rdquo; similar to those of New
Holland, at the death of any eminent person. In fact, upon this, as
upon all other points unconnected with masses and sermons, there exists
a degree of ignorance which is almost incredible. The early
missionaries, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>in their rage for <i>nominal</i> conversion,
appear to have neglected entirely the history or origin of their
neophytes; and, as in America, where the monuments of ages were
crumbled to the dust to plant the cross, all that related to the
history of their converts was considered as unprofitable, if not as
impious, the devil<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1134src" href=
"#xd27e1134" name="xd27e1134src">13</a> being compendiously supposed to
preside over their political as well as religious institutions in all
cases. In this belief, and in its consequent effects, the modern
missionaries, who are mostly Indian priests, are worthy successors of
their Spanish predecessors.</p>
<p>The government have many missions established for the purpose of
converting them, but with little success. Like most savages, their mode
of life has to them charms superior to civilization, or rather to
Christianity (for here the terms are not synonimous); and they rarely
remain, should they even consent to be baptized, but on the first
caprice, or exaction of tribute, which immediately takes place, and
sometimes even precedes this ceremony, return again to their
mountains.</p>
<p>Exposed to all inclemencies of the weather, and with an unwholesome
and precarious diet, they perhaps rarely attain more than forty years
of age. Their numbers are supposed rather to diminish than increase;
and in a few years this race of men, with their language, will probably
be extinct. It is indeed a curious subject of enquiry, whether the
language of those of the eastern islands has any, and what resemblance
to those of Africa, or the southern parts of New Holland and Van
Dieman&rsquo;s Land?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1144src" href=
"#xd27e1144" name="xd27e1144src">14</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>They are not represented as very mischievous; but if strangers
venture too far into their woods, they consider it an aggression, and
repel it accordingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85"
name="pb85">85</a>]</span>with their arrows. Those who frequent the
Spanish settlements are rather of a mild character; and there are
instances of Spanish vessels being wrecked on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>coast,
whose people, particularly the Europeans, have been treated by them in
the kindest manner, and carefully conducted to the nearest settlement.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>The character of the different tribes appears, however, to vary in
this particular: some are described as treacherous and cruel, and those
which inhabit the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88"
name="pb88">88</a>]</span>north western coasts of the Bay of Manila are
accused of having frequently attacked the boats of ships, when these
were not sufficiently guarded in their intercourse with them. The
natives of the town in the Bay of Mariveles, at the entrance of that of
Manila, assured the writer of these pages, that it would be madness to
attempt accompanying them into the woods, even in disguise; and in this
they persisted, though money was offered them to allow him to proceed
with them.</p>
<p>The Indians are the descendants of the various Malay tribes which
appear to have emigrated to this country at different times, and from
different parts of Borneo and Celebes. Their languages, though all
derived from one stock (the Malay), has a number of dialects differing
very materially; so much so, that those from different provinces
frequently do not understand each other.</p>
<p>They differ too in their character, and slightly in their manners
and customs. The most numerous class of them are the Bisayas,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1240src" href="#xd27e1240" name=
"xd27e1240src">18</a> (a Spanish name, from their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>anciently painting their bodies, and using
defensive armour). These inhabit the largest part of the southern
islands. Luzon contains several tribes, of which the most remarkable
are the Ylocos, Cagayanes, Zambales, Pangasinanes, Pampangos, and
Tagalos. These still retain their national distinctions and characters
to such a degree, that they often occasion quarrels amongst each other.
Of their general character as a nation we are now to speak.</p>
<p>The Indian of the Phillippine Islands has been strangely
misrepresented. He is <i>not</i> the being that oppression, bigotry,
and indolence, have for 300 years endeavoured to make him, or he is so
only when he has no other resource. Necessity, and the force of example
have made <i>those of Manila</i>, what the whole are generally
characterized as&mdash;traitors, idlers, and thieves.</p>
<p>How, under such a system as will be afterwards described, should
they be otherwise? Say rather, that all considered, it is surprising to
find them what they are; for they are in general (I speak of the Indian
of the provinces), mild, industrious, as far as they dare to be so,
hospitable, kind, and ingenuous. The Pampango is brave,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1258src" href="#xd27e1258" name=
"xd27e1258src">19</a> faithful, and active; the fidelity of the Cagayan
is proverbial; the Yloco and the Pangasinanon are most industrious; the
Bisayan is brave and enterprising almost to fool-hardiness:&mdash;they
are all a spirited, a proudly-spirited race of men; and such materials,
in other hands, would form the foundation of all that is great and
excellent in human nature.</p>
<p>But for 300 years they have been ground to the earth with
oppression. They have been crushed by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>tyranny; their spirit has
been tortured by abuse and contempt, and brutalized by ignorance; in a
word, there is no injustice that has not been inflicted on them, short
of depriving them of their liberty; and in a work published at Madrid
in 1819 (<span lang="es">Estado de las Yslas Filipinas</span>, par
[<i>sic</i>; for <i lang="es">por</i>] Don Tomas Comyn), whose author
was a factor of the Phillippine company, a whole chapter (the 4th) is
devoted to the mild and humane project &ldquo;of establishing Spanish
agriculturists throughout the islands,&rdquo; who are, &ldquo;to
require a certain number of Indians from the governors of towns and
provinces, who are to be driven to the plantations, where they are to
<i>be obliged</i> to work a certain time, the price of their labour
being fixed, and then to be relieved by a fresh drove!&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1278src" href="#xd27e1278" name=
"xd27e1278src">20</a></p>
<p>Such a system, incredible as it may appear, has been proposed to a
Spanish cortes; and still more wonderful, plans like these excited no
reprobation in Manila. Such were Spanish ideas of governing Indians!
Justice would almost tempt us to wish that this scheme had been carried
into execution, and that the Indian had risen and dashed his chains on
the heads of the authors of such an infernal project. And yet the
Indian is marked out as little better than a brute; so many of them
are, but to the system of government, and not to the Indian, is the
fault to be ascribed.</p>
<p>It is not here meant to accuse the Spanish laws; many of them are
excellent, and would appear to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91"
href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>have been dictated by the very
spirit of philanthropy. But these are rarely enforced, or if they are,
delay vitiates their effect. That this colony, the most favoured
perhaps under heaven by nature, should have remained till the present
day almost a forest, is a circumstance which has generally excited
surprise in those who are acquainted with it, and has as generally been
accounted for by attributing it to the <i>laziness</i> of the Spaniards
and Indians. This is but a superficial view of the subject; one of
those general remarks which being relatively a little flattering to
ourselves, pass current as facts, and then &ldquo;we wonder how any one
can doubt of what is so generally received.&rdquo;&mdash;The cause lies
deeper, man is not naturally indolent. When he has supplied his
necessities, he seeks for superfluities&mdash;if he can enjoy them in
security and peace;&mdash;if not&mdash;if the iron gripe of despotism
(no matter in what shape, or through what form it is felt), is ready to
snatch his earnings from him, without affording him any
equivalent&mdash;then indeed <span class="corr" id="xd27e1290" title=
"Source: be">he</span> becomes indolent, that is, he merely provides
for the wants of to-day. This apathy is perpetuated through numerous
generations till it becomes national habit, and then we falsely call it
nature. It cannot be too often repeated, that from the poles to the
equator, man is the creature of his civil institutions, and is active
in proportion to the freedom he enjoys. Who that has perused the
History of Java by Sir S. Raffles,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1293src"
href="#xd27e1293" name="xd27e1293src">21</a> and seen the effects of
government planned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92"
name="pb92">92</a>]</span>by the talents of Minto in the <i>spirit</i>
of the British constitution in that country, will now accuse the
Javanese of unwillingness to work, if the fruits of his labour are
secured to him? And yet we remember when a Javanese was another name
for every thing that is detestable. It is ever thus&mdash;we blame the
race, because that flatters our pride&mdash;we should first look to
their institutions. I return to the Phillippines.</p>
<p>The cause, then, of their little progress is &ldquo;<i>because there
is no security for property</i>;&rdquo; or in other words, the
smallness of the salaries of the officers of justice, as well as of
other members of government, and the profligacy inseparable from all
despotic governments, have laid the inhabitants under that curse of all
societies, venal courts of justice. Does an unfortunate Indian scrape
together a few dollars to buy a buffalo, in which consists their whole
riches? Woe to him if it is known; and if his house is in a lonely
situation&mdash;he is infallibly robbed. Does he complain, and is the
robber caught? In three months he is let loose again (perhaps with some
trifling punishment), to take vengeance on his accuser, and renew his
depredations.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Indian families are yearly ruined in this manner.
Deprived of their cattle, on which they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>depend for subsistence,
they grow desperate and careless of future exertion, which can but lead
to the same results, and thus either drag on a miserable existence from
day to day, or join with the robbers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1326src" href="#xd27e1326" name="xd27e1326src">23</a> to pursue
the same mode of life, and to exonerate themselves from paying tributes
and taxes, in return for which no protection is granted. In many
provinces this has been carried to such an extent, that whole districts
are rendered impassable by the robbers,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1335src" href="#xd27e1335" name="xd27e1335src">24</a> who even
lay villages under contribution!</p>
<p>This is the state of the inland towns. On the coasts, and while a
flotilla of gun-boats is maintained at an expense of upwards of half a
million of dollars annually, there is no part safe from the attacks of
the Malay pirates from Borneo, Sooloo, and Mindanao. These make regular
cruises to procure slaves, and have even not unfrequently carried them
off, not only from the <i>bay</i> of Manila,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1343src" href="#xd27e1343" name="xd27e1343src">25</a> but even
from within gun-shot of its ramparts! The very soldiers and sailors
sent for their protection plunder them. An Indian in whose
neighbourhood troops are posted, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94"
href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>or who sees the gun-boats
approaching, can no longer consider his property safe; and in the very
vicinity of Manila, soldiers ramble about with their loaded muskets,
and pilfer all they lay hands upon at midday!<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1356src" href="#xd27e1356" name="xd27e1356src">26</a></p>
<p>Does the Indian, in spite of all this, escape, and by patient
industry make a little way in the world? he is vexed with offices; he
is chosen Alguazil, Lieutenant, and Captain of his town; to these
offices no pay is attached, they always occasion expenses and create
him enemies; he is pinched or cheated by the Mestizos, a forestalling,
avaricious, and tyrannical race. Does he suffer in silence? it is a
signal for new oppressions: does he complain? a law suit. The Mestizos
are all connected, they are rich, and the Indian is poor.</p>
<p>The imperfect mode of trial, both in civil and criminal cases (by
<i>written</i> declarations and the decisions of judges alone), lays
them open to a thousand frauds; for if the magistrate be supposed
incorruptible, his notaries or writers (<span lang=
"es">escribanos</span> and <span lang="es">escribientes</span>) are not
so; and from their knavery, declarations are often falsified, or one
paper is exchanged for another whilst in the act of or before signing
them.</p>
<p>To such a degree does this exist, that few Indians, even of those
who can read Spanish tolerably, will sign a declaration made before a
magistrate without threats, or without having some one on whom they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>can depend, to assure them they may safely do so.
Nor is this to be wondered at, when it is known that declarations on
which the life or fortune of an individual may depend are left, often
for days, in the power of writers or notaries, any of whom may be
bought for a doubloon; and some of them are even the menial servants of
the magistrate! This applies to Luzon. In the other islands, this
miserable system is yet worse: they have seldom but one communication a
year with the capital, to which all causes of any magnitude are sent
for decision or confirmation; and, as the papers are often (purposely)
drawn up with some informality, the cause, after suffering all the
first ordeal of chicane and knavery, experiences a year&rsquo;s delay
before it is even allowed a chance of being exposed to that which
awaits it at Manila. Or should the cause be at length carried to the
Audiencia, or Supreme Court, and there, <i>as is sometimes the
case</i>, be judged impartially, the delay of the decision renders it
useless&mdash;the sentence is evaded&mdash;or treated with contempt!
This may appear almost incredible, but known to any person who has
resided in Manila.</p>
<p>While the civil power is thus shamefully corrupt or negligent of its
duties, the church has not forgotten that she too has claims on the
Indian. She has marked out, exclusive of Sundays, above 40 days in the
year on which <i>no</i> labour can be performed throughout the islands.
Exclusive of these are the numerous local feasts in honor of the patron
saints of towns and churches.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1396src" href=
"#xd27e1396" name="xd27e1396src">27</a> The influence of these extends
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>often through a groupe of many islands, always to
many leagues round their different sanctuaries; and often lasting three
or four days, sometimes a week, according to his or her reputation for
sanctity; so that including Sundays, the average cannot be less than
110 or 120 days lost to the community in a year. This alone is a heavy
tax on the agricultural classes, by whom it is most severely felt; but
its consequences are more so, from the habits of idleness and
dissipation which it engenders and perpetuates. These feasts are
invariably, after the procession is over, scenes of gambling, drinking,
and debauchery of every description.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;And mony jobs that day begun,</p>
<p class="line">Will end in houghmagandie.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1429src" href="#xd27e1429" name="xd27e1429src">29</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Thus they unsettle and disturb the course of their
labours <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>by calling off their attention from their domestic
cares; and by continually offering occasions of dissipation destroy
what little spirit of economy or foresight may exist amongst so rude
and ignorant a people. Nor is this all; they are subject to numerous
other vexations and impositions under the title of church-services;
such are, in some towns, five or six men attendant daily in rotation to
bring the sick to the church to confess, or to carry the
&ldquo;Padre&rdquo; with the host to their houses, and many others; all
of which, though in themselves trifles, are more harassing, from their
unsettling tendency, than pecuniary imposts. An encouragement to
celibacy and its consequent evils is also to be found in the (to them)
heavy expenses attendant on all the domestic offices of religion, as
matrimony, baptism, &amp;c., as well as in the increase of the poll-tax
on married persons, for the whole of which the husband is responsible.
The ecclesiastical expenses of a marriage between the poorer classes
are about five dollars: the others, as christenings, buryings, &amp;c.,
in proportion. These appear trifles; but if to these are added the
confessions, <i>bulas</i>, [<i>i.e.</i>, of the Crusade] and other
exactions, it will be seen that these constitute no trifling part of
the oppressive and ill managed system which has so much contributed to
debase their real character.</p>
<p>I say nothing here of the natural effect of the Roman Catholic
religion on an ignorant people, who imagine, that verbal confession and
pecuniary atonements (<i>rarely to the injured person</i>) are a salvo
for crimes of all magnitudes: that such is the case, is notorious to
every one who has visited Catholic countries. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us for a moment retrace this picture. To whom after this is it
attributable that the Indian is often a vicious and degraded being,
particularly in the neighborhood of Manila?</p>
<p>If he sees all around him thieving and enjoying their plunder with
impunity, what wonder is it that he should thieve also? If his
tribunals of all descriptions afford him no redress, or place that
redress beyond his reach, what resource has he but private
revenge?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1459src" href="#xd27e1459" name=
"xd27e1459src">30</a> If he cannot enjoy the fruits of his labour in
peace, why should he work? If he is ignorant, why has he not been
instructed? There exist scarcely any schools to teach him his duties:
the few that do exist teach him Latin! prayers! theology!
jurisprudence! and some little reading and writing;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1465src" href="#xd27e1465" name="xd27e1465src">31</a> but he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>is only taught to read the lives of the saints,
and the legends of the church, whose gloomy, fanatical doctrines and
sanguinary histories have not a little contributed to make him at times
revengeful and intolerant. Does he prevaricate and flatter? It is
because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>he <i>dare</i> not speak the truth, and because
a long system of oppression has broken his spirit.</p>
<p>Does he endeavour to advance himself a few steps in civilization?
his attempts are treated with ridicule and contempt;<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1484src" href="#xd27e1484" name="xd27e1484src">32</a> hence he
becomes apathetic, careless of advancement, and often insensible to
reproach. The best epithets he hears from Spaniards (often as ignorant
as himself) are &ldquo;<span lang="es">Indio!</span>&rdquo; The God of
nature made him so. &ldquo;<span lang="es">Bruto!</span>&rdquo; He has
been and is brutalized by his masters. &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">Barbaro!</span>&rdquo; He is often so by force, example, or even
by precept. &ldquo;<span lang="es">Ignorante!</span>&rdquo; He has no
means of learning; the will is not wanting. In a word, the spirit of
the followers of Cortes and Pizarro, appears to have left its last
vestiges here, and perhaps the Indian has been saved from its
persecutions only by the weakness of the Spaniard.</p>
<p>Such are some of the causes which have marked the character of the
Indian, which is not naturally bad, with some of its prominent
blemishes. I am far from holding up the Indian of the Phillippines as a
faultless being; he is not so; <i>the Indian of Manila<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1516src" href="#xd27e1516" name=
"xd27e1516src">34</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>has all the vices attributed to
him</i>; but I assert, that the Phillippine islander owes the greater
part of his vices to example, to oppression, and above all to
misgovernment; and that his character has traits, which under a
different system, would have produced a widely different result.</p>
<p>To sum up his character:&mdash;He is brave, tolerably faithful,
extremely sensible to kind treatment, and feelingly alive to injustice
or contempt; proud of ancestry, which some of them carry to a remote
epoch; fond of dress and show, hunting, riding, and other field
exercises; but prone to gambling and dissipation. He is active,
industrious, and remarkably ingenious. He possesses an acute ear, and a
good taste for music and painting, but little inclination for abstruse
studies. He has from nature excellent talents, but these are useless
for want of instruction. The little he has received, has rendered him
fanatical in religious opinions; and long contempt and hopeless misery
has mingled with his character a degree of apathy, which nothing but an
entire change of system and long perseverance will efface from
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1544src" href="#xd27e1544" name=
"xd27e1544src">36</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Mestizos are the next class of men who inhabit these islands:
under this name are not only included the descendants of Spaniards by
Indian women and their progeny, but also those of the Chinese, who are
in general whiter than either parent, and carefully distinguish
themselves from the Indians. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>The Mestizos are, as the name
denotes, a mixed class, and, with the creoles of the country, like
those of all colonies, when uncorrected by an European education,
inherit the vices of both progenitors, with but few of the virtues of
either. Their character has but few marked traits; the principal ones
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>their vanity, industry, and trading ingenuity:
as to the rest, money is their god; to obtain it they take all shapes,
promise and betray, submit to everything, trample and are trampled on;
all is alike to them, if they get money; and this, when obtained, they
dissipate in lawsuits, firing cannon, fireworks, illuminations,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>processions on feast days and rejoicings, in
gifts to the churches, or in gambling. This anomaly of actions is the
business of their lives. Too proud to consider themselves as Indians,
and not sufficiently pure in blood to be acknowledged as Spaniards,
they affect the manners of the last, with the dress of the first, and
despising, are despised by both.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1572src"
href="#xd27e1572" name="xd27e1572src">37</a> They however, cautiously
mark on all occasions the lines which separate them from the Indians,
and have their own processions, ceremonies, inferior officers of
justice, &amp;c., &amp;c. The Indian repays them with a keen contempt,
not unmixed with hatred. And these feuds, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>while they contribute
to the safety of a government too imbecile and corrupt to unite the
good wishes of all classes, have not unfrequently given rise to affrays
which have polluted even the churches and their altars with blood.</p>
<p>Such are the three great classes of men which may be considered as
natives of the Phillippine Islands. The Creole<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1584src" href="#xd27e1584" name="xd27e1584src">38</a> Spaniards,
or those whose blood is but little mingled with the Indian ancestry,
pass as Spaniards. Many of them are respectable merchants and men of
large property; while others, from causes which will be seen hereafter,
are sunk in all the vices of the Indian and Mestizo.</p>
<p>The government of the Phillippine Islands is composed of a governor,
who has the title of Captain General, with very extensive powers; a
Teniente Rey, or Lieutenant Governor; the Audiencia or Supreme Court,
who are also the Council. This tribunal is composed of three judges,
the chief of whom has the title of Regent, and two Fiscals or Attorney
Generals, the one on the part of the king, the other on that of the
natives, and this last has the specious title of &ldquo;Defensor de los
Indios.&rdquo; The financial affairs are under the direction of an
Intendant, who may be called a financial governor. He has the entire
control and administration of all matters relative to the revenue, the
civil and military auditors and accountants being under him. Commercial
affairs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>are decided by the Consulado, or chamber of
commerce, composed of all the principal, and, in Manila, some of the
inferior merchants. From this is an appeal to a tribunal &ldquo;de
Alzada&rdquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, of appeal] composed of one judge and two
merchants, and from this to the Audiencia, without whose approbation no
sentence is valid.</p>
<p>The civic administration is confided to the Ayuntamiento (Courts of
Aldermen or Municipality). This body, composed of the two Alcaldes,
twelve Regidors (or Aldermen) and a Syndic, enjoy very extensive
privileges, approaching those of Houses of Assembly; their powers,
however, appear more confined to remonstrances and protests,
representations against what they conceive arbitrary or erroneous in
government, or recommendations of measures suggested either by
themselves or others. They have, in general, well answered the object
of their institution as a barrier against the encroachments of
government, and as a permanent body for reference in cases where local
knowledge was necessary, which last deficiency they well supply.</p>
<p>The civil power and police are lodged in the hands of a Corregidor
and two Alcaldes: the decision of these is final in cases of civil
suits, where the value in question is small, 100 dollars being about
the maximum.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1610src" href="#xd27e1610"
name="xd27e1610src">39</a> Their criminal jurisdiction extends only to
slight fines and corporal punishments, and imprisonment preparatory to
trial. The police is confided to the care of the Corregidor, who has
more extensive powers, and also the inspection and control of the
prisons.</p>
<p>To him are also subject the Indian Captains and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>Officers of towns, who are annually elected by
the natives. These settle small differences, answer for disturbances in
their villages, execute police orders, impose small contributions of
money or labour for local objects, such as repairs of roads, &amp;c.
&amp;c. They also have the power of inflicting slight punishments on
the refractory. To them is also confided the collection of the
capitation or poll-tax, which is done by dividing the population of the
town or village into tens, each of which has a Cabe&ccedil;a (or head),
who is exempt from tribute himself, but answerable for the amount of
the ten under him. This tax is then paid to the Alcalde or Corregidor,
and from him to the treasury. The Mestizos and Chinese have also their
captains and heads, who are equally answerable for the poll-tax.</p>
<p>The different districts and islands, which are called provinces, and
are 29 in number, are governed by Alcaldes. The more troublesome ones,
or those requiring a military form of government, by military officers,
who are also Corregidors. Samboangan on the south west coast of
Mindanao, and the Marianas, have governors named from Manila, and these
are continued from three to five years in office.</p>
<p>These Alcaldeships are a fertile source of abuses and oppression:
their pay is mean to the last degree, not exceeding 350 dollars per
annum, and a trifling per centage on the poll-tax. They are in general
held by Spaniards of the lower classes, who finding no possible
resource in Manila, solicit an Alcadeship. This is easily obtained, on
giving the securities <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href=
"#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>required by government for
admission to these offices, which consist in two sureties<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1631src" href="#xd27e1631" name=
"xd27e1631src">40</a> to an amount proportionable to the value of the
taxes of the province, which all pass through the Alcalde&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>Of the nature and amount of these abuses an idea will be better
formed from the following abridged quotations, which are translated
from the work of Comyn before quoted (p. 16).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1639src" href="#xd27e1639" name="xd27e1639src">41</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed common enough to see the barber or lacquey of a
governor, or a common sailor, transformed at once into the Alcalde in
chief of a populous province, without any other guide or council than
his own boisterous passions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without examining the inconvenience which may arise from
their ignorance, it is yet more lamentable to observe the consequences
of their rapacious avarice, which government tacitly allows them to
indulge, under the specious title of permissions to trade (<i lang=
"es">indultos</i>).</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;and these are such that it may be asserted,
that <i>the evil which the Indian feels most severely is derived from
the very source which was originally intended for his assistance and
protection</i>, that is, from the Alcaldes of the provinces, who,
generally speaking, are the determined enemies and the real oppressors
of their industry. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a well known fact, that far from promoting the felicity
of the provinces to which he is appointed, the Alcalde is exclusively
occupied with advancing his private fortune, without being very
scrupulous as to the means he employs to do so: hardly is he in office
than he declares himself the principal consumer, buyer, and exporter of
every production of the province. In all his enterprises he requires
the forced assistance of his subjects, and <i>if</i> he condescends to
pay them, it is at least only at the price paid for the royal works.
These miserable beings carry their produce and manufactures to him, who
directly or indirectly has fixed an arbitrary price for them. To offer
that price is to prohibit any other from being offered&mdash;to
insinuate is to command&mdash;the Indian dares not hesitate&mdash;he
must please the Alcalde, or submit to his persecution: and thus, free
from all rivalry in his trade, being the only Spaniard in the province,
the Alcalde gives the law without fear or even risk, that a
denunciation of his tyranny should reach the seat of government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To enable us to form a more correct idea of these iniquitous
proceedings, let us lift a little of the veil with which they are
covered, and examine a little their method of collecting the
&lsquo;tributo&rsquo; (poll-tax).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government, desirous of conciliating the interests of the
natives with that of the revenue, has in many instances commuted the
payment of the poll-tax into a contribution in produce or manufactures:
a year of scarcity arrives, and this contribution, being then of much
higher value than the amount of the tax, and consequently the payment
in produce a loss, and even occasioning a serious want in their
families, they implore the Alcalde to make a representation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>to government that they may be allowed to pay
the tribute for that year in money. This is exactly one of those
opportunities, when, founding his profits on the misery of his people,
the Alcalde can in the most unjust manner abuse the power confided to
him. He pays no attention to their representations. He is the zealous
collector of the royal revenues;&mdash;he issues proclamations and
edicts, and these are followed by his armed satellites, who seize on
the harvests, exacting inexorably the tribute, until nothing more is to
be obtained. Having thus made himself master of the miserable
subsistence of his subjects, he changes his tone on a sudden&mdash;he
is the humble suppliant to government in behalf of the unfortunate
Indians, whose wants he describes in the most pathetic terms, urging
the impossibility of their paying the tribute in produce&mdash;no
difficulty is experienced in procuring permission for it to be paid in
money&mdash;to save appearance, a small portion of it is collected in
cash, and the <i>whole amount</i> paid by him into the treasury, while
he resells at an enormous profit, the whole of the produce (generally
rice) which has been before collected!&rdquo; <i>Comyn</i>, p. 134 to
138.</p>
<p>This extract, though long, is introduced as an evidence from a
Spaniard (not of the lower order, or a disappointed adventurer, but a
man of high respectability), of the shameless abuses which are daily
practiced in this unfortunate country, and of which the Indian is
invariably the victim: <i>and it is far from being an overcharged
one</i>. Hundreds of other instances might be cited,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1683src" href="#xd27e1683" name="xd27e1683src">42</a> but this
one will perhaps <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span>suffice to exonerate the writer of these
remarks from suspicion of exaggeration, in pointing out some of the
most prominent of them.</p>
<p>While treating of the government of the Phillippines, we must not
forget the ministers of their religion, and the share which they have
in preserving these islands as dominions to the crown of Spain. This
influence dates from the earliest epoch of their discovery. The
followers of Cortes and Pizarro, with their successors, were employed
in enriching themselves in the new world; and the spirit of conquest
and discovery having found wherewith to satiate the brutal avarice by
which it was directed, abandoned these islands to the pious efforts of
the missionaries by whom, rather than by force of arms, they were in a
great measure subdued; and even in the present day, they still preserve
so great an influence, that the Phillippines may be almost said to
exist under a theocracy approaching to that of the Jesuits in
Paraguay.</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical administration is composed of an Archbishop (of
Manila), who has three suffragans, Ylocos, Camarines, and Zebu; the
first two on Luzon, the last on the island of the same name. The
revenue of the Archbishop is 4000, and that of the bishops 3000 dollars
annually. The regular Spanish clergy of all orders are about 250, the
major part of which are distributed in various convents in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>the
different islands, though their principal seats are in that of Luzon;
and many of them, from age or infirmity, are confined to their convents
in Manila.</p>
<p>The degree of respect in which &ldquo;the Padre&rdquo; is held by
the Indian, is truly astonishing. It approaches to adoration, and must
be seen to be credited. In the most distant provinces, with no other
safeguard than the respect with which he has inspired the Indians, he
exercises the most unlimited authority, and administers the whole of
the civil and ecclesiastical government, not only of a parish, but
often of a whole province. His word is law&mdash;his advice is taken on
all subjects. No order from the Alcalde, or even the
government<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1713src" href="#xd27e1713" name=
"xd27e1713src">43</a> is executed without his counsel and approbation,
rendered too in many cases the more indispensable from his being the
only person who understands Spanish in the village.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e1722src" href="#xd27e1722" name="xd27e1722src">44</a> To their
high honour be it spoken, the conduct of these reverend fathers in
general fully justifies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>and entitles them to this
confidence. The &ldquo;Padre&rdquo; is the only bar to the oppressions
of the Alcalde: he protects, advises, comforts, remonstrates, and
pleads for his flock; and not unfrequently has he been seen, though
bending beneath the weight of years and infirmity, to leave his
province, and undertake a long and often perilous voyage to Manila, to
stand forward as the advocate of his Indians; and these gratefully
repay this kind regard for their happiness by every means in their
power.</p>
<p>Their hospitality is equally praiseworthy. The stranger who is
travelling through the country, no matter what be his nation or his
religion,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1734src" href="#xd27e1734" name=
"xd27e1734src">45</a> finds at every town the gates of the convent open
to him, and nothing is spared that can contribute to his comfort and
entertainment. They too are the architects and mechanists: many of them
are the physicians and schoolmasters of the country, and the little
that has been done towards the amelioration of the condition of the
Indian, has generally been done by the Spanish clergy.</p>
<p>It is painful, however, to remark, that much that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>might have been done, has been left undone. The
exclusive spirit of the Roman church, which confines its knowledge to
its priests, is but too visible even here: they appear to be more
anxious to make Christians, than citizens, and by neglecting this last
part of their duty, have but very indifferently fulfilled the
first,&mdash;the too common error of proselytists of all denominations,
which has probably its source in that vanity of human nature, which is
as insatiable beneath the cowl as under any garb it has yet
assumed.</p>
<p>Some of them too have furnished a striking but melancholy proof of
the eloquent moral,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;It is not good for man to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Let us draw a veil over these infirmities. He who has
lived amidst the busy hum of crowds, amidst the wild whirl of human
passions and interests, can have but little conception of the state of
that mind, which perhaps feeling alive to the blessings of social
intercourse, is cut off for years from civilized men; and thus buried
mentally, is constrained to seek <i>all</i> its resources within
itself.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1751src" href="#xd27e1751" name=
"xd27e1751src">46</a> That heart is one of powerful fibre which does
not sometimes show itself to be human&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>There are instances indeed of some of them forgetting in a great
measure their language! and of others who have become almost idiots
while yet in the vigour of life!<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1762src"
href="#xd27e1762" name="xd27e1762src">47</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next and lowest order of ecclesiastics are the Indian clergy
(<i lang="es">clerigos</i>); they are in number from 800 to 1000, and
though from the want of Spaniards, the administration of many large
districts and towns is confided to them, they are as a body far from
being worthy of such an important charge. The majority of them are
ignorant to the last degree, proud, debauched, and indolent: in a word,
they unite the vices of the priesthood to those of the Indian, and form
a class of men who may <i>almost</i> be said to be distinguished by
their vices only.</p>
<p>This arises from various causes, of which the principal appears to
be that of their being entirely excluded from the higher ecclesiastical
situations. This alone, by depriving them of the most powerful stimulus
to correct conduct, together with the very confined education they
receive, and the impassable line drawn between them and the Spanish
clergy, whom they are never allowed to approach, and who treat them
with much contempt, are sufficient to account, in a great measure, for
their apparent demerit. The fact, however, is such, whatever be its
cause; and seldom a week passes, or at most a month, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>some
of them are brought before the ecclesiastical tribunals, under
accusations but little creditable to their cloth.</p>
<p>Their ordinary resort at Manila is the cockpit or the gaming table,
where they shew an avidity and keenness which are disgraceful and
shameless to the last degree. Yet to the guidance of beings like these
is the unfortunate Indian in a great measure abandoned, even in his
last moments: for from the very great proportion of these to the
Spanish priests, and from the recluse lives of the latter, nearly
nine-tenths of all the clerical duties are performed by the Indian
<i lang="es">clerigos</i>, such as I have described them. The few who
do form an exception, are men whose conduct is highly creditable to
themselves, and more striking from its unfrequent occurrence.</p>
<p>A keen and deadly jealousy subsists between these and the Spanish
ecclesiastics, or rather a hatred on the one side, and a contempt on
the other. The Indian clergy accuse these last of a neglect of their
ecclesiastical duties, of vast accumulations of property in lands,
&amp;c., which, say they, &ldquo;belong to <i>us</i> the
Indians.&rdquo; The Spaniards in return treat them with silent
contempt, continuing to enjoy the best benefices, and living at their
ease in the convents. From what has been said, it will be easily seen,
&ldquo;that much may be said on both sides;&rdquo; but these
recriminations have the bad effect of debasing both parties in the eyes
of the natives, and are the germs of a discord which may one day
involve these countries in all the horrors of religious
dissentions.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1796src" href="#xd27e1796"
name="xd27e1796src">48</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>Such are the civil and ecclesiastical government of the
Phillippines. We turn now to the Revenue and Expenditure, Military
establishments, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Until very lately these rich islands have been a constant burden to
the crown of Spain, money having been annually sent from Mexico to
supply their expenses. The establishment of the monopoly of tobacco has
principally contributed to supply this deficiency. It was established
by an active and intelligent governor (Vasco) about 1745 [<i>sc.</i>,
1785] and still continues to be the principal revenue of the country;
and large sums have been from time to time sent home to Spain, as a
balance against those received from Mexico. The sales of this article
amount more or less to a million of dollars per annum. The extensive
establishment which is kept up to prevent smuggling, and the expenses
of purchase and manufacture, reduce its net produce to 500,000 dollars
per annum. The plant is cultivated in the districts of Gapan in
Pampanga, in a part of the province of Cagayan, and in the island
Marinduque to the south of Luzon. It is delivered in by the cultivators
at fixed prices, and sent to Manila, where it is manufactured in a
large range of buildings dedicated to that purpose, and retailed to the
public at about 18 to 19&frac12; dollars per arroba of 25 lbs.
(Spanish), the prices varying a little according to the harvests.</p>
<p>The administration, inspection, and manufacture <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>of
this article, employ several thousand persons of both sexes (the
manufacturing process being almost wholly carried on by women). This is
not only the most productive, but the best conducted branch of the
revenue; while it is at the same time the least vexatious in its
operations, though not exempt from those objections which are common to
all government monopolies.</p>
<p>Another of these monopolies is that of Coco wine, as it is called
(vino de Coco y nipa). This is a weak spirit produced from the juice of
the Toddy tree (Borassus gomutus),<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1821src"
href="#xd27e1821" name="xd27e1821src">49</a> and from the nipa (Cocos
nypa): of this, large quantities are used by the natives. The expense
of collection is about 80,000 dollars, the net revenue to government
varying from 2 to 300,000.</p>
<p>The poll-tax (tributo) is the other great branch of the revenue; the
manner of collecting it is described in p. 29. Its amount to each
individual is, with some exceptions and variations in different
provinces, 14 rials, or 1&frac34; dollars for every married Indian,
from the age of 24 to 60. The Mestizos pay 24 rials or 3 dollars, and
the Chinese 6 dollars each: this last branch is generally farmed. The
amount of Indian and Mestizo tribute may be stated in round numbers at
800,000 dollars: the expense of collecting it diminishes it to about
640,000. The exemptions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>from it are disbanded soldiers,
who pay less than others, men above 60 years of age, and the
cultivators of tobacco, or makers of wine for the royal monopolies.</p>
<p>The collection of this tax is always attended with much trouble, and
it is detested by the Indians to the last degree. The exaction of it
from the newly converted tribes,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1857src"
href="#xd27e1857" name="xd27e1857src">50</a> and the extensive frauds
which, as already detailed, are practised by means of it, render it the
most oppressive of all impositions. The natives consider it (perhaps
with some justice), as giving money to no purpose; and infallibly evade
it by every means in their power.</p>
<p>The customs produce from 1 to 300,000 dollars per annum. The
remaining part of the revenue is derived from various minor sources:
such are the cockpits, which are farmed, and produce a net revenue of
25 to 40,000 dollars;&mdash;the Chinese poll-tax, 30,000
dollars;&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="es">Bulas</span>,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1865src" href="#xd27e1865" name=
"xd27e1865src">51</a> (the sale of which is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>farmed, and produces from 10 to 12,000
dollars);&mdash;cards, powder (a monopoly), stamps, and other articles
of minor importance; amongst which was formerly the monopoly of betel
nut, which is now abolished.</p>
<p>The expenses of administration are as follows. The civil and
ecclesiastical officers of government, 250,000 dollars. The military,
including all classes, about 600,000; and the marine, about
550,000.</p>
<p>The excess of revenue over the expenditure is stated by Comyn to
have been in 1809 about 450,000 dollars, but in this is included
250,000 received from Mexico.</p>
<p>In 1817, by an account published by order of the Ayuntamiento of
Manila, the amount of the revenue was&mdash;</p>

<p>of which a surplus would remain when all the expenses were
liquidated. In preceding years, some surplus has been remitted to
Spain.</p>
<p>The military establishment consists of three regiments of infantry,
one of dragoons, a squadron of hussars, and a battalion of artillery,
in all about 4500 regulars. The militia are numerous, but only one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>regiment is under arms: the total of men may be
estimated at 5000, but on an emergency, large bodies of irregulars can
be called into activity. In 1804, the governor, Don J. M. de Anguilar,
[<i>i.e.,</i> Aguilar] is <i>said</i> to have had upwards of 20,000 men
under arms, being in expectation of an attack from the English.</p>
<p>These troops (which are all natives) are in general badly
disciplined and officered, mostly by country-born officers, without the
advantage of an European education, ignorant of their military duties
to the last degree, many of them (more especially in the Mestizo
regiments) connected with the soldiers by relationship, or at least by
the tie of mutual indulgence, the soldier performing every menial
office for the officer, who in return winks at the excesses of the
soldier. This is carried to such an extent, that, not to mention such
trifles as a garden wall or gate, a bathing house, or a stable, or at
times a little smuggling; there are instances on record, where the
commanding officer of a regiment has built himself a country house! the
whole of the masonry and carpentry being performed by soldiers of his
regiment! Another is of a captain collecting his debts by means of a
piquet of infantry; taking possession of his debtor&rsquo;s house until
payment was made!</p>
<p>It will be easily conceived, that where these things are permitted,
the soldiers are made subservient to other purposes; accordingly they
have been employed to punish the paramours of their officers&rsquo;
wives&mdash;to eject a troublesome tenant&mdash;or at times to take
vengeance for affronts, in cases where it might not be safe for the
injured person to do so.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1946src" href=
"#xd27e1946" name="xd27e1946src">53</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>These remarks apply more particularly to the Mestizo officers. The
Spaniards, and some of the creoles, who are but very few in number,
form a respectable class of military men, of whom some few may be cited
as models of spirit and discipline: but they are not sufficiently
numerous for their example to influence the despicable beings with whom
they are unavoidably associated; and the wealth and influence being
generally on the side of the native-born officers, these abuses are
permitted, and the complaints of others disregarded.</p>
<p>It is but just, however, to remark, that their pay is excessively
mean; it is a bare, and miserable subsistence; and due weight should be
given to this circumstance in extenuation. A captain of regulars has
not more than 80 dollars per month! and so on in proportion, and when
we reflect, that from the low value of the circulating medium, a dollar
will barely command more than a rupee in any part of India, much must
be allowed for men so situated.</p>
<p>Hence, though the men, arms, and accoutrements are not bad, the
troops are, from abuses, embezzlement, and neglect, miserably deficient
in a military point of view, and but poorly calculated to answer any
efficient purpose. To this description, the regiment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>of
artillery and Pampango militia are exceptions: the style of equipment
and discipline of the first are a high testimony of the activity and
military talents of their colonel. The queen&rsquo;s regiment is by far
the most respectable of the infantry.</p>
<p>Their cavalry are badly mounted, the horses being very small, and by
no means good. The men too are clumsily equipped, with swords
manufactured apparently in the 14th century, being straight,
disproportionably long, and furnished with a steel poignet or basket,
above which is a cross, resembling the rapiers of that time.</p>
<p>Their marine is still more miserably deficient in the requisite
qualities for essential service, and suffers more from the
mal-administration of its various branches. All work done in the royal
arsenal is computed to cost at least 40 per cent. more than that by
individuals! The marine consists of a flotilla of 40 or 50 gun-boats,
and as many feluccas,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1971src" href=
"#xd27e1971" name="xd27e1971src">54</a> of which about one half, or
fewer, may be in constant activity; with what effect has been already
remarked.</p>
<p>Like the army, the navy is almost entirely officered by creoles and
Mestizos, whose pay is but a subsistence, and consequently no prospect
is offered to young men of family and enterprise who may have other
resources.</p>
<p>The arsenal at Cavite, about 10 miles from Manila, is well provided
with officers and workmen, but has no docks. Vessels, however, may
heave down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>with great safety; and the work, though
expensive, is remarkably well executed.</p>
<p>The agriculture of this very fertile country is yet in its infancy.
Oppressed with so many enemies to his advancement, and placed in a
climate where the slightest exertion insures subsistence, the Indian
has, like the majority of his Malay brethren, been content with
supplying his actual wants, without seeking for luxuries. Hence, and
from the expulsion of the Jesuits, they have made no advances beyond
the common attainments of the surrounding islanders.</p>
<p>This spirited and indefatigable order of men, who, both by precept
and example, encouraged agriculture, not only as the source of national
greatness, but as preparatory to, and inseparable from, conversion to
Christianity, which <i>they</i> well knew did not consist alone in
ceremonies, but in fulfilling the duties of citizens and men, and who,
whatever were their political sins, certainly possessed more than any
other the talent of converting men from savage to civilized life, have
left in the Phillippines some striking monuments of their
wide-spreading and well-directed influence. Extensive convents (the
ground stories of which were magazines), in the centre of fertile
districts formerly in the highest state of cultivation, but now more
than half abandoned,&mdash;tunnels,&mdash;canals,&mdash;reservoirs and
dams, by which extensive tracts were irrigated for the purposes of
cultivation, attest the spirit with which they encouraged this science;
and if their expulsion was a political necessity, it certainly appears
to have been in this country a moral evil.</p>
<p>The restraints imposed on commerce were another insuperable bar to
their prosperity, as depriving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126"
href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>them of a market for their
produce. Since foreigners have been allowed free intercourse with them,
their agriculture has in some degree improved by the increased demand
of produce; but under the present system, but little can be expected
from it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1991src" href="#xd27e1991" name=
"xd27e1991src">55</a></p>
<p>The soil is in general a rich red mould, with a great proportion of
iron, and in some districts volcanic matters; it is easily worked and
very productive: that in the immediate vicinity of Manila, and for four
or five miles round it, extending to that distance from the coast of
the Bay, is an alluvial soil, formed by the confluence of the numerous
rivers with the ocean; it is stiff, and in all respects very inferior
to the other. In some parts are extensive tracts, the reservoirs of the
waters from the mountains in the rainy season, which first yield an
amazing supply of fish,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2004src" href=
"#xd27e2004" name="xd27e2004src">56</a> and then a good crop of rice or
pasture for the buffaloes.</p>
<p>The frequent rains, and the numerous rivers and streams with which
the country is every-where intersected, adds to its extraordinary
fertility: it is seldom, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>if ever, afflicted with droughts,
but is at times <span class="corr" id="xd27e2027" title=
"Source: devasted">devastated</span> by locusts (perhaps once in 10 or
15 years), and these make dreadful havoc amongst the canes. Their
attacks, however, are partial, and generally take place after the rice
is harvested, in December, disappearing before the rains. In 1818,
nearly the whole of the canes were destroyed by them, and the
Ayuntamiento of Manila expended from 60 to 80,000 dollars in
<i>purchasing</i> large quantities of them, which were thrown into the
sea.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2033src" href="#xd27e2033" name=
"xd27e2033src">58</a></p>
<p>The buffalo is universally used in all field labours, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>for
which, however, he is but poorly calculated: the slowness of his pace,
and his great suffering from heat, which obliges the labourer to bathe
him frequently, occasion a very considerable loss of time, which is
scarcely compensated by his great strength and little expense in
keeping. Indeed, the bullock should perhaps be on all occasions
substituted for him, excepting only in the cultivation of rice fields.
In a few districts, this is the case; but it is with reluctance that
the native uses him in preference to the buffalo.</p>
<p>Their breed of horses is small, but very hardy: they are never used
for agricultural purposes, though but few of the peasants are without
one for riding, and many of them have two or three. In the province of
Pampanga (the finest tribe of Indians in the Phillippines), they risk
considerable sums on races! of which they are very fond.</p>
<p>Their plough is of Chinese origin: it has but one handle, and no
coulter or mould-board, the upper part of the share, which is flat, and
turned to one side, performing this part of the work. The common harrow
is composed of five or six pieces of the stems of the thorny bamboos,
which at the lower part are almost solid; these are united by a long
peg of the same, passing through all the pieces: to these the hard
branches of thorns are left appending, and being cut off at a short
distance from the stem, form the teeth of the instrument, which, rude
as it is, performs its work well, and usefully, and is seldom out of
order.</p>
<p>For cleaning and finally pulverizing the ground, they have another
harrow of Chinese origin, (or an invention of the Jesuits?) It is of
wrought iron, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span>for simplicity and utility it is, I think,
unequalled. By means of it they can extirpate the Lallang grass
(<i lang="la">Andropogon caricosum</i>), called by them Cogon,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2079src" href="#xd27e2079" name=
"xd27e2079src">60</a> and which no other instrument will perform so
well, that I am acquainted with.</p>
<p>A hoe, like that of the West Indies, answers the purposes of a
spade; and (with the basket) of a shovel. A large knife (the Malay
Parang), called &ldquo;Bolo,&rdquo; completes the list of their
agricultural instruments. Machinery they cannot be said to possess,
except a rude mill of two cylinders for cane, and another for grinding
their rice, can be called such. The greater part of the rice is beaten
from the husk in wooden mortars, and by hand.</p>
<p>The rainy season commences with the S. W. monsoon, and ends in
October. The rice (the aquatic sorts) is planted by hand in July and
August, and reaped in December. The upland rice, of which they have two
varieties, is planted earlier, and comes sooner to maturity. The cane
is planted in the manner called &ldquo;en canon&rdquo; by the French,
that is, the plant piece is stuck diagonally into the ground; and thus,
from the roots being often on the surface, the plant suffers frequently
from drought, and they have seldom two crops from a piece of cane:
their sugar, though clumsily manufactured, is of excellent grain, and
highly esteemed by the refiners of Europe.</p>
<p>The indigo plant is very fine; and though, as in all countries, a
precarious crop, yet it is far from being so much so as in India: it
<i>has</i> been manufactured equal to Guatemala, but in the present day
is of a very inferior quality: this arises from various causes, of
which the principal are ignorance in the manufacture <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>of
it, a want of capital, and spirit of enterprise. They have no tanks of
masonry, the whole process being carried on in two wooden vats of a
very moderate size, from which the fecula is taken once a week. It is
needless to remark, that the quality of the indigo is materially
injured by this alone: it is also subject to many adulterations in the
hands of the Mestizos, before being brought to market.</p>
<p>The coffee plant was almost entirely unknown about 40 years ago, a
few plants only existing in the gardens about Manila. It was gradually
transported from thence to the towns in the neighbourhood of the lake,
where it has been since multiplied to an amazing degree by an
extraordinary method. A species of civet cat with which the woods
abound, swallows the berries,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2100src" href=
"#xd27e2100" name="xd27e2100src">61</a> and these passing through the
animal entire, take root, and thus the forests are filled with wild
plants. This fact may be depended upon, and the major part of all the
coffee exported from Manila is produced from the wild plants, and is
equal or superior in flavour to that of Bourbon. The government, in
1795 or 96, made an attempt to force its cultivation in the province of
Bulacan, but forgot, as one of their own officers <i lang=
"es">naivement</i> observes, &ldquo;<span lang="es">Que no habia
compradores ni consumidores</span>&rdquo;&mdash;that there were neither
consumers or customers for it! It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>of course fell to the ground,
and in the next passage of the same work, the <i>Indian</i> is partly
blamed for it!</p>
<p>The cultivation of cotton is as yet but very partial. It is of the
herbaceous species, of a very fine quality, almost equalling the
Bourbon, but excessively adherent to the grain: so much so indeed, that
none of the attempts to separate it from the seed by machinery have
hitherto succeeded; the grains passing through the rollers, and
staining the cotton. It is cleared by the natives by means of a
hand-mill, very clumsy in its construction, and performing so little
work, that the cleaning costs six dollars per pekul.</p>
<p>The principal part of the cotton comes from the province of Ylocos,
where large quantities of stuffs are manufactured. The brown cotton,
for which a prize was offered in 1818 by the Society of Arts, grows in
great quantities, and is manufactured into durable cloths and blankets.
The prices of agricultural labour vary from 1 rial<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2142src" href="#xd27e2142" name="xd27e2142src">63</a> per day
near Manila to &frac34; and &frac12; rial in the provinces&mdash;a
plough with two buffaloes and a man, 2&frac12; rials. The workmen, like
day labourers in all countries, are often &ldquo;looking for
sunset;&rdquo; but when allowed task work, are willing and industrious.
A plough will go over rather more than a loan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2145src" href="#xd27e2145" name="xd27e2145src">64</a> of ground
in a day&mdash;about a quinion in three months. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of the produce of any given cultivation, it is difficult to speak
with any degree of correctness: calculations of this kind are difficult
to make amongst a people labouring each for himself, and all for the
wants of the day: for, unaccustomed to generalize, each gives <i>his
own</i> as the average, and hence the discrepancy which every person
must have remarked who has had occasion to make inquiries of this
description in half civilized countries, where a main point, the value
of the labourer&rsquo;s time, and of that of his animals, is invariably
left out, as is also the difference of work for himself and for a
master. The tables given at the conclusion of Comyn&rsquo;s work are,
as far as regards the vicinity of the capital, very erroneous. They are
also very deficient in many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>points.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2215src" href="#xd27e2215" name="xd27e2215src">67</a> The
following is a much nearer approximation.</p>

<p>The profits of the refiner would <i>appear</i> high; and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>they have been so; but are far from what this
statement appears to give, from various reasons, of which the chief
are, the heavy capital sunk in buildings, interest on advances, &amp;c.
and from a want of knowledge, the enormous waste of labour in the
process. A glance at this may give an idea of what trade is at these
antipodes of commercial knowledge.</p>
<p>I have termed the process &ldquo;refining;&rdquo; it should rather
be called claying and sorting&mdash;and it is as clumsily managed as
the ingenuity of man could well devise. The trade is principally in the
hands of three or four capitalists; advances are made by these to
brokers, the provincial merchants, who annually bring their produce to
the capital in small vessels,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2472src" href=
"#xd27e2472" name="xd27e2472src">69</a> and to the masters of coasting
traders, in which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
"#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>sugar merchants have shares. These
are made to a large amount, 80 to 100,000 dollars; and as the interest
of this must at least run for six months at 9 per cent. it forms a
heavy item. Losses and defaulters form another, say &frac12; per cent.
in all 5 per cent.</p>
<p>The pilones are delivered from November to May and June, and are
received into extensive warehouses, which are provided with large
court-yards and terraced roofs. Here the upper part of the pilone is
cut off, and a quantity of manufactured sugar being pressed down on the
top of it, a thin layer of the river mud is put on it; this is watered
from time to time and changed once or twice, the pilone standing on a
small foot, with the small hole at its apex left open, through which
the molasses slowly drains, leaving the upper and broader part of the
pilone of a fine white, gradually decreasing in goodness to the bottom,
where it is little more than molasses&mdash;the pilone is then cut in
two; the darker part is put by as second quality (or reboiled), and the
whiter portion as firsts, of the sugar, the care taken in the process,
the kind of mud used, &amp;c. About two piculs of sugar from three
pilones is a fair average, when these are of a good size. That from the
province of Pampanga is by far the best; it is produced from a small
red cane<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2482src" href="#xd27e2482" name=
"xd27e2482src">70</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>about four feet high, and of the
thickness of a good walking stick.</p>
<p>The sugar being thus clayed, is now to be mixed, pounded, and dried.
The last process is performed by laying it on small mats in the sun, on
the terraces and pavements of the court-yards. On the slightest
appearance of rain, it must be hurried under cover, and brought out
again when this is past. So that in a manufacture of any size, when
from 3 to 400 Chinese are employed at 4&frac12; dollars per month,
fully &#8531;d of their labour is expended on this operation alone. The
management of the rest requires no comment.</p>
<p>The cost of production of any of the other articles cannot be
estimated to any degree of correctness, from the very small scale on
which they are cultivated, and the limited knowledge of the writer of
these remarks. Those of Comyn are erroneous.</p>
<p>The Indians are the principal and almost the only cultivators of the
soil, very few Mestizos or Chinese<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2508src"
href="#xd27e2508" name="xd27e2508src">71</a> being engaged in it. The
few Spaniards and other Europeans who have attempted it, have been
obliged to abandon their attempts to form plantations. These failures,
or rather determination to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>abandon their speculations (even
when in a promising state), have arisen from various causes; but the
general one may be stated to be the very little security for life and
property, in a country such as has been described. This is with the
major part an insuperable objection; for from the moment they are
established, and known to possess money for the payment of their
workmen, they must be in expectation of an attack, and prepared to
defend themselves; nor can they lie down at night free from the
apprehension of seeing their establishments in flames before morning!
either from robbers, or from malice of any individual who may think
himself aggrieved:&mdash;the impossibility of obtaining justice so
generally experienced by the Indians, and the many chances of escaping
punishment, being strong inducements to the ill-disposed to adopt these
modes of revenge. To this it may be added, that even were the foreigner
to kill the most determined robber in the country, the circumstance of
having done so in defence of his life and property, would by no means
exonerate him from a fleecing by the inferior officers of justice, and
from a long and tiresome process of depositions, declarations, &amp;c.
during which his affairs must be entirely neglected.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2526src" href="#xd27e2526" name="xd27e2526src">73</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>In addition to this he must lay his account with another obstacle,
and this none of the smallest&mdash;the chance of bad faith on the part
of those with whom he is connected; a chance which by no means will
diminish in proportion to his success; for, let no foreigner deceive
himself on this head in Manila; if he cannot flatter as low, or bribe
as high as his adversary, his cause is lost by some means or other.</p>
<p>The Phillippines also produce cacao of an excellent quality, though
not sufficient for their consumption, a large quantity being imported
from New Spain.</p>
<p>Pepper is also an article of exportation, but in very limited
quantities, the utmost the Phillippine Company have been able to
procure being about 60,000 lbs. in favourable years.</p>
<p>To these may be added the Abaca (<span lang="la">Musa
textilis</span>), a species of plantain, from which the beautiful
fibres are procured known by that name. This is becoming a very
considerable article of exportation, both raw, and manufactured into
cordage. The natives also consume large quantities of it in cordage,
and as shirting cloth, into which a large portion of the interior
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>and finer fibres are manufactured. Some of it is
equal to the coarser sort of China grass cloth.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In Gogo,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2572src" href="#xd27e2572" name=
"xd27e2572src">76</a> a gigantic climbing plant, whose trunk attains
the size of a man&rsquo;s body, is another remarkable production of
these islands. Its branches being cut out into lengths, are coarsely
pounded and dried in the sun: they are used as soap by all classes of
people, the saponaceous fluid which is extracted from them being
remarkably cleansing, and the fibres answering the purpose of a
brush.</p>
<p>It is also used in large quantities in washing the earth of rivers
and streams, to separate the gold from them. It is not cultivated, but
exists in great abundance in the forests, in which are also the
sapan-wood (called Sibacao), the sandal, ebony, and vanilla. They
abound in gums and resins, large portions of which are washed down by
the torrents; but these are for the most part useless, either from the
ignorance of the natives, or from the impossibility of venturing far in
the interior.</p>
<p>Their timber is excellent, and in a country so covered with forests,
of course plentiful; but the want of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>roads and other
conveniences of transport, renders it, in Manila, rather an expensive
article.</p>
<p>The principal timber woods are, the &ldquo;Mulave&rdquo;
[<i>i.e.</i>, Molave], a compact, heavy, yellowish wood, and almost
incorruptible, perhaps from the very great portion of tannin it

&amp;c. when great hardness is required. &ldquo;Betis,&rdquo; an
excellent timber tree, which grows to a very great size, and for its
durability is generally used for the main beams of churches, convents,
and other large buildings. The &ldquo;Narra,&rdquo; of which there are
two kinds, the white and red: this last is almost equal to mahogany in
polish and durability. Banaba, a red wood resembling cedar; and many
others of equal goodness. Of these the Banaba and Mulave are most used
in shipbuilding, the first for planking, and the last for the
framework. For masts, the Manga-chapuy and Palo-maria are generally
used: the last is equal or superior to pine, both in strength and
lightness.</p>
<p>Their forests are not infested with those ferocious animals which
are the terror of those of other Asiatic countries. The tiger,
elephant, and rhinoceros are unknown: the wild buffalo and hog are the
only ones of which the native has any dread. These attain an enormous
size, but are not mischievous, unless provoked. The dried flesh and
hides of these animals, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>as well as of deer and wild
cattle, which are in immense numbers, form a considerable article of
trade amongst the natives, the &ldquo;tappa&rdquo; or dried flesh being
used for food, and the hides for exportation.</p>
<p>Their serpents, however, attain an enormous size: the largest are
those of the Boa species (Constrictor), and will devour a horse or a
cow at a meal.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2657src" href="#xd27e2657"
name="xd27e2657src">79</a> Of this genus there is one variety very
beautifully marked, which frequents the houses, and is called by the
Spaniards (<span lang="es">Culebra casera</span>), the house
snake,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2663src" href="#xd27e2663" name=
"xd27e2663src">80</a> and by the Indians &ldquo;Sawa.&rdquo; These are
often seen from 10 to 12 feet in length, but are very harmless. Few
houses are without one or more of them in the cellars, stables, &amp;c.
but they are seldom disturbed, as they are <i>said</i> to devour rats
and other noxious animals; though, when these fail them, they attack
fowls, or even goats. They form a favourite article of food with the
Chinese, who keep them in jars to fatten, and the Indians may be often
seen carrying them through the streets for sale.</p>
<p>Of other varieties they have great numbers; some of which, as the
&ldquo;<span lang="tl">dahun palay</span>,&rdquo; or <i>leaf of
rice</i>, of a deep green and yellow, which frequents the rice fields,
and the &ldquo;<span lang="tl">mandadalag</span>,&rdquo; or whip-snake,
are excessively venomous: accidents from these animals are not,
however, very frequent; from whence it may be concluded, that the
superstition of the natives has greatly exaggerated the number of
venomous ones: and this may be the more readily inferred, not only from
their excessively superstitious character, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>the
common custom of all nations in this particular; but also from the
thousand ridiculous fables told by them of the cameleon, which is very
common in the woods, and perfectly harmless. The Indian name for it is
&ldquo;Ynyano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of minerals they have an inexhaustible supply: gold is found in
almost all the streams, and even in the sands of the shores of the Bay
after blowing weather: no mines of it have as yet been wrought, though
they are known to exist. The quantity obtained by the rude efforts of
the natives merely washing the sands of the torrents, is very great,
and certainly does not fall short of 4 to 500,000 dollars worth
annually, as great quantities are expended in gilding for the churches,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>Silver is also found, but in small quantities. Virgin copper is
another produce of their mountains: pieces of it are frequently met
with in the torrents, and on the shores of some of the islands
(Masbate, Burias, and Ambil). The negroes have also been seen with rude
ornaments, and even with utensils made from it.</p>
<p>Of iron they have whole mountains in the very vicinity of Manila!
(provinces of Pampanga and Bulacan), some of the ores yielding 75 per
cent. of metal, and of an excellent quality, this having been
ascertained by some Biscayan iron-masters sent out for that purpose. It
contains great numbers of magnets. There are some miserable
establishments for working and smelting these ores, but on a very small
scale; they have only produced cast iron articles, and those of an
inferior quality. They have no forging machinery.<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=

<p>Cinnabar, lead, and tin are supposed to exist; but of these last
there is no certainty.</p>
<p>Sulphur is found in the neighbourhood of the volcanoes in
considerable quantities, and is an article of export to Bengal and
other places: the principal part of it is collected on the island of
Leyt&eacute;, which is next to Samar on the south side of the strait of
St. Bernardino. It is collected on the edges of numerous small
apertures, which emit at times flames and smoke. These are situated in
an extensive plain near the sea-coast in the vicinity of the village of
Dulag, on the eastern side of the island. With these natural
advantages, and those are not few that still remain to be enumerated,
the commerce of this country, like its agriculture, is still in its
infancy: and this has been principally owing to two great
causes&mdash;the trade to Acapulco, and the prohibitory system
invariably pursued by Spain in regulating the intercourse with her
colonies, and which here has been burdened with an additional weight,
the monopoly of the Phillippine Company.</p>
<p>It were a task far exceeding the intention and ability of the writer
of these remarks to point out the causes and effects of these extensive
evils:&mdash;a few observations only will be made to elucidate such
remarks as may follow on the commerce of Manila.</p>
<p>Of the prohibitory system pursued by Spain towards her colonies, it
may perhaps be said, with as much justice as of her wars, that it was,
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">en faire un desert pour s&rsquo;en assurer
l&rsquo;empire;</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2732src" href=
"#xd27e2732" name="xd27e2732src">83</a> for few systems <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>could have been better calculated to assure the
first object; the last has miserably disappointed its advocates, and
left a striking lesson to the world, at which humanity has cause to
rejoice.</p>
<p>With jealousy of foreigners exceeding even the bounds of
credibility, she invariably refused them admittance,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2741src" href="#xd27e2741" name="xd27e2741src">84</a> whether
for scientific or commercial purposes;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2749src" href="#xd27e2749" name="xd27e2749src">85</a> or when
from accident or influence this was obtained, the people following, and
often exceeding the lessons of their rulers, by civil and religious
persecutions, and contempt, contrived to render their existence almost
a burden. It would appear to have become an axiom amongst them,
remarkable only for its illiberality, that &ldquo;a dollar gained by
foreigners was one taken from the pocket of a Spaniard;&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2761src" href="#xd27e2761" name=
"xd27e2761src">86</a> and that in all cases where the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>interests of the merchants of the mother country
and those of the colonies were opposed, the latter were to be
sacrificed.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2774src" href="#xd27e2774" name=
"xd27e2774src">87</a> Her own subjects were, from the same miserable
narrow policy, embarrassed with restrictions and
conditions&mdash;permissions from the Consejo de las Yndias, &amp;c.
&amp;c. that it became by no means a trifling affair to be able to
embark for the Phillippines, unless at the risk of being sent home from
there by the local authorities.</p>
<p>Unable herself, from the want of manufactures and energy, to profit
by her colonies, she obstinately refused to allow others to do so, and
in this she invariably persisted. The fruits of such a system were such
as might have been expected; the colonies submitted&mdash;(while they
were obliged by force to do so), smuggled to a large amount,
remonstrated, resisted, and declared themselves independent; and thus
has Spain forever lost those advantages which a more liberal policy
might have secured to her through a long course of time.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2779src" href="#xd27e2779" name=

"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Philippines, this system, though followed for a long time,
has been of late years successively relaxed, and the good effects of
this modification are visible to the most indifferent observer: it has
however left deep traces of its operations, and much is still wanting:
the foreign merchant or adventurer, how much soever he may be smiled
upon and caressed, has still to contend against a rooted and long
cherished jealousy of all that is not Spanish.</p>
<p>The Acapulco trade is another and a principal cause of the very
confined state of the commerce of this valuable colony. A few remarks
will be sufficient to justify the apparent paradox.</p>
<p>The merchant of Manila (says Comyn), is &ldquo;entirely different
from the merchant of other parts of the world; he has no extensive
correspondence, no books, or intricate accounts; his operations are
confined to a shipment of bales to Acapulco, and to receiving the
silver in return: and in 40 years, only one or two instances have
occurred wherein bankrupts have been able to produce a correct set of
books to the Consulado (or Chamber of Commerce)!&rdquo; This
description was doubtless correct at the time when it was written
(1809); but it is just to observe that they are now much improved, and
though not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>excessively enterprising, are better acquainted
with the true principles of commerce. Such were the merchants: let us
examine a little the trade.</p>
<p>The basis of it was, and is, the funds called &ldquo;Obras
Pias&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2806src" href="#xd27e2806" name=
"xd27e2806src">89</a> (Pious Works). These are funds under various
denominations, whose origin was the piety of well-meaning Spaniards,
who dying rich have bequeathed large sums for the purpose of lending to
deserving traders to commence or continue their career with. The
administration of these is confided to various religious and charitable
institutions, or to civil associations&mdash;the trustees forming a
board, at which the sums to be lent, &amp;c. are determined. Their
statutes differ in many unessential points;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2814src" href="#xd27e2814" name="xd27e2814src">90</a> but their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>general tenour is the same, viz. that sums not
exceeding two thirds of the fund shall be lent on respondentia at
certain rates of interest, which are fixed according to the risk of the
voyages; and these, when repaid, shall be added, principal and
interest, to the original fund. The interests are 25 per cent. to
Acapulco, 15 to Bengal, and so in proportion. The total of the capitals
of these establishments (there are 12 or 14 of them), amounted to about
three millions and a half of dollars in 1820, of which about two
millions are due to the funds on various risks, principally those of
New Spain: of this the major part is considered as lost by those best
qualified to judge of the subject.</p>
<p>The principal employ of these funds has been in the commerce to
Acapulco; and from the facility with which capital was procured, the
excessive gambling spirit which this introduced, as well as the system
of mutual accommodations from the trustees of different funds, and the
utter absence of the wholesome restraint of public examinations of
their accounts, it has resulted that more harm than good has been done
by these establishments. The original intentions are entirely
perverted, a few small sums being lent to young adventurers (when they
have powerful friends), but far the greatest part is employed by the
trustees themselves under the name of a relation or friend.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2826src" href="#xd27e2826" name=
"xd27e2826src">91</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>When, without risking any capital of his own, the merchant might
thus share the enormous profits of this trade, with no more exertion
than signing the invoices and letters (they were written by Indian
clerks), and receiving the treasure on the return of the vessel, it is
not surprising that for nearly two centuries they neglected all the
other commercial advantages which surrounded them, or that such a
commerce produced such merchants: the history of it and of them for
that period may be confined to a few words:&mdash;they were the agents
of the merchants of Madras and Bengal, receiving and shipping their
goods, and returning their proceeds, while their profits were confined
to a large commission on them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2837src"
href="#xd27e2837" name="xd27e2837src">92</a></p>
<p>This trade was anciently confined to a single ship annually, the
famous Galleon. She was fitted out, manned and armed, at the
king&rsquo;s expense, and commanded by a king&rsquo;s officer. This was
reimbursed by a duty of 33&#8531; per cent. on the registered cargo,
the merchants contributing to her provisionment, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>and
to the payment of 20,000 dollars as a bounty to her commander. She was
calculated to carry 3,000 bales of a certain size, and the privilege of
shipping these was confined to the holders of 1,000 tickets called
&ldquo;boletas,&rdquo; which were divided amongst different public
bodies, charitable and religious institutions, the widows of the
officers, &amp;c., these tickets being saleable to others:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2844src" href="#xd27e2844" name=
"xd27e2844src">93</a> and of the enormous profit on this trade, some
idea may be formed, when it is known, that with the very heavy expenses
attendant on every stage of it, 500 dollars have been paid for a ticket
entitling the holder to ship three bales!</p>
<p>By regulation, the invoice was not to exceed 500,000 dollars; but
this was always evaded. The vessels were crammed with goods, and
generally netted 100 per cent. or even 150 on every thing taken
out.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2855src" href="#xd27e2855" name=
"xd27e2855src">94</a> By applications from private merchants, the
permissions have of late years been extended to their ships, and even
brigs; but they still were encumbered with many useless restrictions
and conditions, which of course were evaded by every means that could
be devised.</p>
<p>By the adoption of the new constitution, and the late declaration of
the independence of Mexico,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2866src" href=
"#xd27e2866" name="xd27e2866src">95</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>which began in the
seizure of a convoy of nearly a million of dollars belonging to the
merchants of Manila, this trade is now almost annihilated.</p>
<p>As has been remarked, their intercourse with the other countries is
very limited. The Phillippine Company, who were in possession of the
exclusive trade of Europe, have for many years taken no advantage of
their privilege (the last ship which arrived from Spain was in
1817);<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2877src" href="#xd27e2877" name=
"xd27e2877src">96</a> but private merchants were still debarred from
doing so, till the promulgation of the constitution.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2880src" href="#xd27e2880" name="xd27e2880src">97</a>
Foreigners have been, however, gradually admitted since 1800; and they
have supplied the wants of the country by introducing European
articles, and carrying off the surplus produce, when a sufficient
quantity could be procured to employ their capital, which rarely
happens without much delay. So rapid has been the augmentation of this
trade, that though in 1813 only 15,000 pekuls of sugar were exported,
it had increased <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span>in 1818 to 200,000, at from 6&frac12; to 9
dollars per pekul. The other exports of the same year were as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Coffee, about 400 pekuls, at 28 dollars; Cotton, 1,000, at 20 to 25
dollars; Indigo, 1,000 quintals, at 90 to 110 dollars per quintal; wax,
600 pekuls at 40 to 50 dollars; red wood, &amp;c. &amp;c. in large
quantities. In a printed account, the number of foreign vessels for
that year (1818) are stated to be, English, 18; American, 10; French,
4; Portuguese, 2; Chinese Junks, 10, and 8 Spanish vessels. The value
of imports as follows:</p>
<div class="table">

<p>The exports, 1,205,649 dollars; but this last is any thing but
correct, not only from the very imperfect nature of the custom-house
valuations, but from the smuggling, which is carried on to an immense
amount. It will be nearer the truth to estimate the imports at about
3,8, or 3,900,000, and the exports at 3&frac14; or 3,500,000.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2915src" href="#xd27e2915" name=
"xd27e2915src">98</a></p>
<p>The imports consist of piece-goods for the Acapulco market, and for
home consumption from Bengal; cambrics and handkerchiefs of plaided
patterns <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>from Madras; woollens, wines, spirits, silks,
printed cottons, hosiery, hardware, &amp;c. from Europe (principally
from France); bird&rsquo;s nests, tortoise and mother-of-pearl shell,
bich-de-mar [<i>i.e.</i>, balate], wax, dried fish, &amp;c. from Soolo,
Borneo, and other islands of the Archipelago; toys, silks, nankeens,
teas, and dollars from China; dollars from the United States; and from
South America, silver, cochineal, and cacao. Of these articles the
specie and cochineal are mostly exported to Bengal and Madras, and the
produce of the Soolos and Borneo to China; the other exports have been
noticed in a preceding page.</p>
<p>An active coasting trade<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2927src" href=
"#xd27e2927" name="xd27e2927src">99</a> is carried on by the natives
amongst the islands, though they suffer dreadfully from the pirates;
but such is their enterprising turn, that <i>with these in sight</i>,
they will often cross from one island to another, when they have a fair
start; and frequently set out on a long trip in a small prow
[<i>i.e.</i>, <i>prau</i>], armed only with their spears and
&ldquo;campilans,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2944src" href=
"#xd27e2944" name="xd27e2944src">100</a> though knowing the pirates to
be in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>the neighbourhood of their track. They are well
known in the piratical states, where a Manila slave always commands a
higher price than any other. They have been much stigmatized in British
country-ships, as the leaders of mutinies, &amp;c.; but though no doubt
can exist that they have often assisted in cutting off vessels, yet I
question much whether the fault was not in a great measure to be
attributed to a want of discrimination between the high spirit of the
Philippine islander, and the meek sufferance of the patient
Lascar&mdash;a fatal mistake, when both are trampled on, as it is to be
feared they but too often are.</p>
<p>This trade is carried on in pontines,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2952src" href="#xd27e2952" name="xd27e2952src">101</a> galeras,
feluccas, and prows or boats of all sizes. The pontines are stout-built
vessels of European models, from 80 to 150 tons, with two long mat
sails, like a Chinese junk. The &ldquo;galeras&rdquo; are smaller, and
carry a lateen sail, like those of the Mediterranean. The feluccas have
been already described, and their prows and boats resemble nearly those
of their Malay brethren. Large property is often embarked in these
vessels, and they are conducted entirely by natives.</p>
<p>They have but a few manufactures: the principal one is that of
coarse gauzes, and rope from the Abaca plant, the first of which has a
very extensive consumption and is universally worn by all classes of
the natives. It is principally carried on in the province of Camarines,
at the S. E. angle of the island.</p>
<p>Considerable quantities of coarse canvas and striped cloths are
manufactured from cotton in the province of Ylocos; and in those in the
more immediate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>vicinity of the capital, the striped cloths
called &ldquo;tapis&rdquo; are universally worn by the native women
over their petticoat. None of these articles except the Abaca rope are
exported, and probably the whole of the cloths might be imported at a
cheaper rate than they are made. The Phillippine Company, by a mistaken
policy, expended large sums in endeavoring to render these manufactures
articles of export to Spain and the Americas; but after heavy and
repeated losses, the attempt was at length abandoned.</p>
<p>I am not certain whether there was not a clause in their charter,
obliging them to attempt this; and from the interfering spirit of
Spanish legislature throughout the last two centuries, it is more than
probable it was so. For the Company must have seen the impropriety of
endeavoring to establish manufactures in a country so thinly populated,
and where the little security for property or power of enforcing
contracts, must have exposed them to a thousand losses unknown in
Europe.</p>
<p>This last circumstance is one which is at all times a severe check
on the prosperity of any undertaking in this country. The most
shameless frauds are daily committed, particularly by the Chinese and
Chinese Mestizos, and for these there is no resource; complaint is
unavailing, for the trouble of obtaining redress is greater than the
injury, and it is a matter of common conversation&mdash;how so and so
has been cheated in his contracts. They appear to mistake indolence for
compassion, and allow themselves to be robbed with impunity, rather
than pursue the offender, or, should they do so, the magistrate to whom
they apply is but too apt, if the affair is intricate, to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>mistake procrastination for deliberation, and
thus the culprit escapes unpunished. The losses of private merchants
and the individuals in this way, would, if enumerated, exceed belief.
Another and a most serious drawback to the commercial prosperity of the
Phillippines, has been the negligence or ignorance, or both which have
prevented the establishment of bonded warehouses, or a system of
drawback duties on re-exportations. A glance at their position, and the
consideration of the monsoons, will convince any one, that this was of
all things that for which ample provision should have been made; and it
would be no exaggeration to say, that this commerce would in a few
years have increased tenfold with China alone, had this plan been
adopted. The enormous duties and vexatious spirit of the Chinese
government, together with, what must doubtless be often the case, the
fleecing combinations of the Hong merchants;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2968src" href="#xd27e2968" name="xd27e2968src">102</a> would long
ago have driven every vessel from their ports, could another have been
found near enough to insure a supply of goods, which, from the
enterprising spirit of the Chinese, could not have failed. Manila is
this port. From Amoy and Nankin, the granaries and workshops of the
eastern provinces, the most fertile and commercial part of the empire,
it is but a short run to Manila; and thus, when the Chinese could
freely trade in their favourite article, opium,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2976src" href="#xd27e2976" name="xd27e2976src">103</a> and find
too an assortment of European <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158"
href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>and Malay goods, while the
European could complete his investment of funds with the valuable
produce <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>of China,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3006src"
href="#xd27e3006" name="xd27e3006src">104</a> without the expense of
the measurement duties, and while the Malay could trade with both, an
emporium might have risen, inferior only perhaps to Batavia or
Calcutta. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>An attempt was made in 1817, by a Spanish merchant, to commence
something of this sort. He purchased a quantity of Turkey opium from an
American, with an understanding that it was to be reshipped, on payment
of a small additional duty. It was so, but a quantity of the opium was
plundered from the custom-house godowns, and the proprietor was told
&ldquo;that the king was not responsible for losses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be foreign to the object of a cursory sketch like the
present to enter farther into the details of this subject. Enough has
been said to bear out an assertion, which those who are acquainted with
the trade will not think exaggerated, that had this system been fairly
and equitably established, one half of the trade to China would before
this have centered at Manila; and it is only at Manila that the
advantages of such a transit could have been unknown or neglected in
the 19th century. I proceed to make some observations on the capital
and its inhabitants.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3027src" href=

an extensive bay in the western coast of the island Luzon, or Luconia,
as it is sometimes called. It is a captain general-ship (not a
viceroyalty), and archbishopric, and the seat of the Audiencia, or
Supreme Tribunal.</p>
<p>The city forms nearly a sector of a circle, of which the center is a
point formed by the coast and the influence of a small but rapid river,
the Passig, which flowing to the westward, and passing to the north of
the city, discharges the waters of an extensive lake about 30 miles
distant from the town. This river is navigable for vessels of 250 tons
for a small distance from its entrance, which is formed by two fine
moles, built by the municipality of the city. On the southern of these
is a small semicircular battery for four guns, and on the other a
light-house. The southern or outer mole is much out of repair.</p>
<p>The constant and rapid current of the river forms a bar at its
entrance, over which there is 10, and at times 11 feet water at spring
tides, in a narrow channel close to the battery.</p>
<p>The city is well fortified on the sea and land faces, but on that
towards the river very indifferently, being only defended by a long
curtain with a few ill-constructed bastions, which from their
diminutive size are rather playthings than bastions. The curtain is
narrow, and confined on the inside, and unfit for guns of calibre; the
buildings within the city overlooking, and even joining the wall in
some places. On the other side of the river, within 200 yards of this
curtain, are a number of stone houses, along the whole length of its
bank; and the bases of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>being walls of eight and ten feet
thick of solid masonry, would afford an immediate cover for an enemy,
who might breach the curtain in ten minutes at so short a distance, and
with perfect safety, the fire from some of these taking the whole of
the works on the N. Eastern side in reverse. Indeed its only defence on
this side is the river,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3067src" href=
"#xd27e3067" name="xd27e3067src">108</a> the current of which is always
rapid.</p>
<p>Over it is a neat but narrow stone bridge of ten arches, which joins
the city at its northern angle to the suburbs. On the city side of the
bridge is a square tower, with an archway pierced through it, and with
embrasures on the top. This is intended as a &ldquo;t&ecirc;te de
pont;&rdquo; but it is too small for any effective purpose, and, like
the bastions on this face, resembles a military plaything; and this
defect is the more striking, as the fortifications, from this angle on
the land and sea faces, are remarkably handsome and well
proportioned.</p>
<p>At the north-western point of the city, which joins the mole, is the
citadel of Santiago, a clumsy old-fashioned fortification, separated
from the rest of the city by a narrow ditch with a stone bridge, but
joined by the curtains of the bastions. It is incapable of any
respectable defence, except from a semicircular bastion, which forms
the point, and commands the moles and entrance to the river. It is now
used as a state prison and magazine. The convicts employed in the
public works are also lodged in it. This was the refuge of the
unfortunate foreigners who escaped from the massacre on the 9th of
October 1820; and to the honour of the commandant (Col. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>Don
A. Parreno), and his lady be it recorded, they found there another
home.</p>
<p>The length of the city within the walls is 1,300 yards Spanish, from
N. W. to S. E.; its width 744, and circumference 4,166. The side
towards the river, it has already been remarked, is, from the want of
bastions, and from the encumbered state of the approaches to it, in a
very defective state. The sea and land faces are exactly the reverse of
this, being remarkably clear and strong.</p>
<p>The land face has a double ditch, and an esplanade of five or six
hundred yards in breadth, which towards the river is marshy and swampy,
and utterly unfit for military operations. Towards the sea, and for
some miles along the coast, is an epaulement,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3080src" href="#xd27e3080" name="xd27e3080src">109</a> thrown up
when in expectation of an attack from the English in 1804. On this
esplanade formerly stood a church, from the tower of which the English
under Sir W. Draper fired into the heart of the city:<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e3085src" href="#xd27e3085" name="xd27e3085src">110</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>it is now razed. There is also a small battery
called Charles the Fourth&rsquo;s, on an elevated spot in the marshy
ground; it is about 350 yards from the fortifications and is mostly
used as an exercising battery. Another redoubt of stone stands at the
southern point of the outer ditch, and flanks the sea shore to a
considerable distance to the southward: it also serves to cover the
head of the outer ditch, which is not carried round the sea face,
apparently for want of room, as its crest would nearly approach high
water mark in this part.</p>
<p>There are six gates to the city, two on each face: those on the land
side have neat stone bridges over the outer ditch, which are not mined,
and, being of solid masonry, would be found cumbersome in case of an
attack. The inner ones, and those on the sea side, are of wood or stone
pillars with drawbridges. The ditches are wide and deep, but much
encumbered with mud and weeds, from which last the fortifications also
have suffered. The bastions on the sea and land sides are in many
places without embrasures, the guns being &ldquo;en
barbette.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3097src" href="#xd27e3097"
name="xd27e3097src">111</a> The shore is not very flat, and will
perhaps allow a frigate to lay within gunshot of the ramparts.</p>
<p>Within the walls of the city is the cathedral, the inside of which
is very handsome, though the exterior is destitute of all symmetry, and
seems to have been intended as a contrast to the majestic architecture
of the interior.</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s palace resembles a decent barn or warehouse,
both externally and internally. It is large, dirty, and ill
distributed, the basement being used as a prison. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Cabildo, or Town House, is a handsome building, and the only one
in the country which has any pretensions to symmetry, of which the
architects of the Phillippines take every opportunity of shewing a
sovereign contempt:&mdash;so much so, that it is rare to find even the
doors and windows, or the angles of a room, correctly placed and laid
out! These three buildings form three sides of a small square, the only
one in the city, of about 100 yards on each side, the fourth side being
occupied by private houses. In the centre is a handsome pedestal of
reddish marble, on which no statue has yet been placed.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3110src" href="#xd27e3110" name=
"xd27e3110src">112</a></p>
<p>The streets of the city are narrow and dirty; and the middle being a
hollow, in rainy weather forms a continued puddle. They are paved at
the sides with granite from China, the stone in the immediate
neighbourhood of Manila being too soft. The pavement is not in good
repair, and in some streets only occupies one side; the other, which is
generally occupied by a large house, or the wall of a convent, being
heaped up with dirt, rendered solid by long <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>accumulation, and forming a hill against the
wall, the receptacle of&#8202;&hellip;. This is not confined to
bye-lanes, but is most common in the great square (<span lang=
"es">Plaza Constitucional</span>) in front of the cathedral!<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3128src" href="#xd27e3128" name=
"xd27e3128src">113</a></p>
<p>The city and suburbs are well lighted, and the European quarters of
the last are cleaner than the city.</p>
<p>The convents, which occupy nearly one third of the whole area of the
city! are more distinguished for their size and massy architecture,
than for their beauty. The church and convent of St. Augustine, and
that of the Jesuits (now fast falling to decay), are, however, neat and
well built. That of San Domingo is the most extensive.</p>
<p>The hospital of St. John of God, a military order of Knights
Hospitallers, is extensive, but for want of funds, is but indifferently
entertained.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3145src" href="#xd27e3145"
name="xd27e3145src">114</a> There is also a university (St. Thomas),
two colleges for the instruction of Indians and mestizos, and three
convents of nuns, who receive girls to educate. There are also two
schools for girls, both endowed by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>piety of single
individuals; the first of these being a Spanish lady, who came out from
Spain for the express purpose of devoting herself to the education of
Indian and mestizo girls! The other is that of a mestizo woman of the
village of Binondo, a suburb of Manila.</p>
<p>There are some large houses, but they are generally ill-built and
inconvenient, the rooms being often excessively large, and always badly
laid out. The ground floor is used for warehouses, stables, &amp;c. and
always includes a large court-yard. The first floor only is inhabited.
The architecture of the lower part is very massive, being often walls
of solid masonry of eight or ten feet thick, with large arches from
side to side, and connected with massy beams. At the height of the
floor, these walls are discontinued, and on them are raised at
distances clumsy pillars of brickwork, or at times of wood (which is
seldom straight). These pillars are connected at the top by large
joists in all directions, having wooden forelocks driven through them
close to the pillars; and on this framework are laid the rafters for
the tiled roof; the interstices of the pillars, and divisions of the
rooms, being filled up with brick and plaster. The ends of the floor
timbers being allowed to project over the walls, form a gallery of
eight or ten feet in width along the front of the house, and round it
when insulated: this gallery is boarded for about four feet in height
in front, and then filled up with sliding windows, the small panes of
which are filled with plates of thin mother-of-pearl shell,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3152src" href="#xd27e3152" name=
"xd27e3152src">115</a> forming one continued window, like <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>the
front of a hot-house. The communication to this gallery is by wide
folding doors from the rooms, a large one having four or five, which
thus admit light and air into the apartments; but the shell windows,
when closed against the sun, transmit an intolerable heat, and the
houses are not in general cool ones. The galleries are often used as
dressing, and even as bathing rooms; and as they overhang the streets,
the passenger is often sprinkled from them, in consequence of this
dirty practice.</p>
<p>The exterior of these galleries being painted a curious mixture of
tawdry colours, such as black, grey, blue, yellow, and red, in panels,
flowers, ovals, &amp;c. on white or grey grounds, with their shell
windows above, and the grated ones of the godowns below, gives a tawdry
and unsociable appearance to the houses. The better sort, and those
newly built, have venetians, which greatly improves both their
appearance and comfort.</p>
<p>All the houses have a cross, and some two or three, on the roof or
gables, as a preservative against evil spirits,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3168src" href="#xd27e3168" name="xd27e3168src">116</a> and
lightning; and though few years pass without many accidents from the
latter, the crosses are still preserved in preference to conductors,
even in the magazines, not one of which is provided with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>this
useful preservative, though that of the citadel contains many thousand
pounds of powder.</p>
<p>The suburbs of the city are extensive, and contain many stone
houses, in which some of the principal inhabitants reside, and
generally all the foreigners, the vicinity of the river, and its many
branches, rendering it more convenient for business.</p>
<p>The custom-house is a plain octagonal building of considerable
extent, and contains a fine courtyard surrounded with an arcade, and
extensive magazines for warehousing goods. These, from neglect and the
ravages of the white ants, are fast falling to decay, and in a few
years the building will be a ruin; it is now very dirty and
ill-arranged, the entrance not being convenient to the river, and
wanting quays and a crane. The officers of this establishment are in
general attentive, civil, and indulgent to foreigners, though the
length of their <i lang="es">siestas</i> does not contribute to the
dispatch of business. There is no interpreter attached to this
establishment, nor is the king responsible for goods or money deposited
in it, this being solely at the merchant&rsquo;s risk.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Calzada,&rdquo; or public drive, is a broad neat carriage
road, leading round the outer face of the outer ditch, from the bridge,
round the land and sea faces of the fortifications to the river. It is
planted with trees, and forms a good drive, having roads leading from
it into the country, whose rich and cultivated appearance gives the
stranger a high opinion of its fertility. The roads are however much in
want of waterings in dry weather, the dust of the principal one being
at these times insufferable.</p>
<p>On the road leading to the village of Santa Anna <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>is
the cemetery,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3193src" href="#xd27e3193"
name="xd27e3193src">117</a> a building well worth the attention of
strangers both as a novelty in itself, and as in some measure redeeming
the character of the architecture of this country from its general want
of interest and symmetry.</p>
<p>It consists of two concentric circular walls, about ten feet apart
and fourteen in height, both surmounted with a balustrade. The inner
wall forms the periphery of a circle of about 250 feet in diameter, and
is pierced with three rows of small semicircular arches, which form the
entrances to as many arched, oven-like receptacles, formed in the space
betwixt the walls, and of a size just calculated to receive a coffin,
to which purpose they are appropriated.</p>
<p>There are from two to three hundred of those receptacles; and when
occupied, the entrances are walled up. The plot of ground in the centre
is crossed by two broad stone walks, the borders of which are planted
with flowers and shrubs; the remaining space is used for
interments.</p>
<p>On the further side from the gate, and joined to the wall, is a
handsome chapel of an oval shape, the roof being a dome. The interior
of this chapel is remarkably neat; and the altar, which is white, and
gold, is particularly so, from its elegant simplicity and chasteness of
ornament: on each side of it are repositories for the remains of
governors and bishops.</p>
<p>Without are flights of steps leading to the terrace <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>joining the walls, and two passages leading to a
smaller building at the back of the chapel, and in the same style as
the large one. This is called the &ldquo;Angelorio&rdquo; and a recess
in it the &ldquo;Ossario.&rdquo; The first is appropriated to the
remains of infants and children, and the last to the bones which may in
time accumulate. This purpose suggests the only objection which is apt
to arise in viewing the building, which is, that, as in the course of
time the receptacles must be filled up, those which have been first
occupied must be opened, and the bones displaced to make room for
others. To many this is a most revolting objection, and would appear to
indicate a dulness of feeling and want of sentiment, which, though far
from being uncommon at Manila, by no means accords with the spirit and
style in which the building is executed, or with the reflections it is
apt to excite.</p>
<p>There are no other buildings in the neighbourhood of Manila worthy
the attention of the stranger. The appearance of the surrounding
country is rich, and in some parts highly cultivated; but an air of
neglect and dilapidation is visible throughout, which strikingly marks
the apathetic character of both classes of its inhabitants. It is
remarkable, too, that the neatness of the native villages, and the
apparent comfort of the people, increase in direct proportion to their
distance from the capital, as the influence of government is less felt,
and the Indian, knowing no other authority than the
&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; retains more of his original character.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>The vices of Spanish colonies have been often the theme of those who
have visited them; and when speaking of Manila, they have seldom
exaggerated.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3218src" href="#xd27e3218"
name="xd27e3218src">118</a> It has been observed, and with some
justice, that &ldquo;to know the education of the children, is to know
the character of a people.&rdquo; If this be true, but little can be
said for Manila, where this highly important duty is more neglected
than perhaps in any civilized part of the globe.</p>
<p>The majority of the young are abandoned entirely to the Indian
servants, who soon familiarize them with all that is vicious. They know
but little of their parents more than as the master and mistress of the
house, whose hand they must kiss, kneeling, every morning and evening.
By five years of age they smoke cigars, ride out at night by moonlight,
abuse the Indians, and not unfrequently their parents. At 12 they are
debauched. At 18 or 20 they marry, and then form the citizens for which
such an education has prepared them. They are seldom or ever taught any
useful employment or profession. This the majority of them would look
upon with the utmost contempt: &ldquo;<span lang="es">Soy gracias a
Dios, de sangre noble</span>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3226src" href="#xd27e3226" name="xd27e3226src">119</a> is their
reply to any advice of this kind; and this is a passport to a cadetship
in the army or colonial marine; which, though attained at the age of 12
or 13, seldom finds them with any vice unlearnt. The girls are educated
nearly in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>same manner, as far as to the acquirement of any
useful knowledge. They are sent to the nunneries till 12 or 14 years,
and from thence married. Of household duties they know little or
nothing, and of any thing else, still less.</p>
<p>The manner of living is nearly as follows: The gentlemen rise about
six or seven, and take chocolate. They then lounge about in their
shirts and trowsers (the former often outside of the latter) till nine,
when they dress, and dictate a letter or two to their writers (they
rarely write for themselves); at 10 they breakfast, after which they go
out in their carriages to transact any business they may have in town.
At 12 or 1 they dine, and from table retire to sleep <i>the siesta</i>,
till 4&mdash;at 4 chocolate<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3239src" href=
"#xd27e3239" name="xd27e3239src">120</a>&mdash;at 5 drive on the
esplanade, or into the country, till 6 or 7, when visits are received
or made till 10 or 11; supper is served hot at this hour, and at
midnight they retire to sleep. Some of these evening parties
(tertulias) are lively and pleasant, but at most of them gambling is
carried on with great avidity. Both ladies and gentlemen smoke at
these, as well as at balls and other assemblies. They drink but little
wine or strong liquors, their ordinary beverage being water, which is
handed round in large glasses with sweetmeats, which are always eaten
before drinking water.</p>
<p>Society in Manila is at a very low standard: in a community, the
majority of which are men of inferior classes, no very select
assemblies can be expected; and those whose character and education
might <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>have given another tone to it, are here, from
necessity, amalgamated with the crowd. There are in fact only a few
houses where a respectable society can be met with; at others the
stranger is disgusted with a coarseness of manners, and with unfeeling
or often excessively indelicate conversation, and an ignorance of the
most common branches of knowledge that must be heard to be
credited.</p>
<p>Hence, exclusive of some of the civil and military officers of
government, the agents of the Company, and a few respectable merchants
and priests, the remainder are but little qualified for select society,
and there exists amongst them a want of moral discrimination, a
toleration of publicly known vicious characters of both sexes, that is
not a little embarrassing to the stranger. This is more particularly
the case with the female part of society, with many of whom
&ldquo;<span lang="es">era tentada la pobrecita por el
demonio</span>!&rdquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;The poor woman was tempted
by the devil&rdquo;] appears to be a salvo, both at confession and in
society, for failings which in Europe inevitably and justly entail
expulsion from it.</p>
<p>Such is the society of Manila, and such its manners: from them the
general character of those who compose it may be easily imagined; they
are polite in <i>offering</i> every thing&mdash;but <i>do</i> but
little or nothing:&mdash;they affect great decency of manners and a
religious deportment in all their actions; but any thing but this is to
be found in the conduct of the generality; and a common remark amongst
themselves, &ldquo;<span lang="es">Esta no es tierra para un hombre de
bien</span>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3271src" href=
"#xd27e3271" name="xd27e3271src">121</a> is worth a chapter on the
subject.</p>
<p>This may be thought an exaggerated, or at least <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>a
highly coloured picture, and it is natural that it should be so. A
recital of a well-known custom may add an evidence to these assertions,
premising that it is not the only, though the most prominent one that
attracts the notice of the stranger: I allude to that of promiscuous
bathing. This shamefully indecent custom could exist in no country
where the common decencies of life were held in due consideration.
Imagine the members of a large family, the father, mother, children,
young and old, any visitors who may be in the house and often part of
another family, all assembled in a large bath, built out on the river
with bamboos, the women with only a petticoat and a gauze chemise, and
the men with a thin pair of drawers, and this continuing for one or two
hours. This is a Manila bath, to which it is no uncommon thing for an
acquaintance to be asked, and in which &#8536;ths of all the families
in Manila indulge. It may be said in extenuation, that from its
frequency no evil arises from it: this <i>may</i> be the case, but it
is not the less indecent on that account.</p>
<p>The policy of Spain towards the Phillippines appears to have been to
preserve them&mdash;no matter how, as it afforded occasion to remark,
&ldquo;that the sun never set in the dominions of his Catholic
majesty.&rdquo; Its neglect of so rich a colony can only be supposed to
arise from ignorance, or from a mistaken determination to sacrifice it
to the Americans: from which, this is not the place to enquire. It will
suffice to observe, that in Spain it has been at all times considered
as the &ldquo;ne plus ultra&rdquo; of expatriation: a natural
consequence of this was the state of society which has been shewn to
exist.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3283src" href="#xd27e3283" name=
"xd27e3283src">122</a> Nor is this idea confined to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>Spain alone: Mr. Whitbread, when addressing the
House on the tyranny of Ferdinand to the liberal party, concluded in
the following manner: &ldquo;Some have perished on the
scaffold&mdash;others in the dungeons of Ceuta&mdash;and others, still
more horrible to relate, have been sent to linger out their days amidst
the savages of the Phillippine islands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The islands have suffered too from another cause, the adoption of
the Spanish language as that of the courts of justice, &amp;c. &amp;c.
and the consequent neglect of that of the natives amongst the higher
classes of Europeans. Hence they are ignorant of the feelings and
prejudices of the people they govern, and who look to them for example,
or at least for precept; and not a little of the extensive influence of
the priesthood may be owing to <i>their</i> intimate knowledge of the
language, and the mutual confidence which results from this. The
Indian, meanwhile, has not neglected the language of his masters; and
as from the Indian writers, who transact all business, every thing is
known, it follows, while both mistakenly consider their interests as
separate, the natives and creoles have much the advantage. Both despise
and detest the Spaniards, the majority of whom, divided into factions
of Andaluces, Montaneses, Serviles, and Liberales,<a class="noteref"

href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>few who know and feel that
there are other and higher duties owing from them to the Indian, must
look on with regret, or complain to be disregarded or insulted. The
disaffected, and those who have nothing to fear and every thing to hope
from a popular commotion, do not lose sight of these advantages; and
are rapidly spreading doctrines gleaned from the works of Voltaire,
Rousseau, Tom Paine; &amp;c. and stimulating them with songs of liberty
and equality; as unfit for them as they were for the creoles and slaves
of St. Domingo, to whose fate the Phillippines are fast verging, and
from which nothing but some extraordinary event can save them.<a class=

<p>The 9th of October, 1820, has given a fatal blow to the power of
Spain in this country; for much as has been written and said on the
subject, it is questionable whether there exists any country of black
men, where the white is not looked upon as an intruder; and &ldquo;the
country belongs to the Indians,&rdquo; &ldquo;La tierra es de los
Yndios,&rdquo; is a common remark, even amongst the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>lower orders. Moral or political injustice
seldom fails to recoil on the head of the oppressor; and when the
government of Manila allowed an indiscriminate massacre and pillage of
European foreigners by the mob, and by their shameful lenity gave a
tacit sanction to it, they taught the Indian, that he might with equal
impunity attack them. The plunder then obtained is a premium to future
violence; and perhaps the day is not far distant, when they may
bitterly repent the hour in which they allowed the Indian to feel his
physical superiority.</p>
<p>This he is now hourly taught, and the doctrine of &ldquo;El Pueblo
Soberano&rdquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the sovereign people&rdquo;] is
hourly echoed in his ears by those who are least capable of managing
him when once aroused. &ldquo;<span lang="es">La
Constitucion</span>&rdquo; is made the pretext for every thing
subversive of good order and due restraint; the convulsed state of
Spain, the imbecile indecision of the present government, and the
recent revolution of Mexico (another example to the many already before
them), will not a little tend to accelerate the crisis to which, it is
to be feared, they are fast approaching; a crisis to which every
political body must be subject, who would govern an ignorant people by
laws made for an enlightened one, and who forget in their speculations,
that though the civil institutions of a people may be changed in a few
hours, their moral character cannot; and on it and its influence
throughout the circle of social intercourse depends the portion of real
freedom which a people can enjoy.</p>

<p class="first">Such was the outline of the state of these islands in
1822. Severe and frequent as the censures are <span class=

writer is not conscious that they are in any instance unjust or
exaggerated, or that praise has been withheld wherever it might be due.
The unprejudiced, honourable, and well-informed, will, he hopes, think
so, the opinion of others is indifferent to him: they will perhaps too
believe, that his object has neither been to flatter nor to wound, but,
if a sketch like this had originally any object, a hope that when their
true state was better known these islands might be better
appreciated&mdash;perhaps better governed; that a cruelly-abused class
of men (the natives) might one day find their condition ameliorated;
and lastly, that when this fair and rich portion of the earth shall be
visited by men of science, a few general remarks on their state at any
given period, however ill drawn up, might be of some use. Who indeed
can but reflect with pain, that while the torch of science has blazed
in the western hemisphere, from Greenland to the Antarctic, bearing
with it light, and life, and hope, and blessings, few are even aware
how very much it has yet to illumine in the East!</p>

Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; and in Chile were joined by the Hungarian
naturalist, Tadeo Haenke (who, reaching C&aacute;diz after their vessel
sailed, was obliged to sail to South America to meet them). From
Acapulco they went to Marianas and Filipinas; and journeyed (1791)
through Luz&oacute;n from Sorsog&oacute;n to Manila. Pineda labored
diligently in Luz&oacute;n, and made large collections; but died at
Badoc, in Ilocos, in 1792; his brother Arcadio Pineda, who was first
lieutenant of the ship, was charged to put in order the materials
collected by Antonio, but many of these were lost on the return
journey. Returning to South America, at Callao Haenke and N&eacute;e
parted company; the former again traveled in America, but in the
vicissitudes of these journeys much of the material collected by him
was lost or spoiled. The residue was classified and described, after

common there [in Manila]; but they do not die from it; the great heat

&ldquo;Non-Christian Tribes of Northern Luzon,&rdquo; Worcester calls
attention to the various indefinite modes of using the word
&ldquo;tribe,&rdquo; among ethnological writers, and proposes (p. 803)
the following definition as a means of securing clearness and accuracy
therein: &ldquo;A division of a race composed of an aggregate of
individuals of a kind and of a common origin, agreeing among themselves
in, and distinguished from their congeners by, physical
characteristics, dress, and ornaments; the nature of the communities
which they form; peculiarities of house architecture; methods of
hunting, fishing, and carrying on agriculture; character and importance
of manufactures; practices relative to war and the taking of heads of
enemies; arms used in warfare; music and dancing, and marriage and
burial customs; but not constituting a political unit subject to the
control of any single individual nor necessarily speaking the same
dialect.&rdquo; He adds: &ldquo;Where different dialects prevail among
the members of a single tribe it should be subdivided into dialect
groups.&rdquo; He also says (p. 798): &ldquo;It was the usage of the
Spaniards to designate as a tribe each group of people which had a
dialect, more or less peculiar, of its own. Furthermore, the custom
which is widespread among the hill people of northern Luzon of shouting
out the name of a settlement when they desire to call for one or more
persons belonging to it, seems in many instances to have led the
Spaniards to adopt settlement names as tribal ones, even when there
were no differences of dialect between the peoples thus
designated.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Eds.</span>&nbsp;<a class=

negro of the east appears to have amalgamated with some other family.
On the south coasts of Australasia, they resemble in many points the
people just described. This continues to be the case as far as Cape
Capricorn. To the northward of this, as far as Murray&rsquo;s Islands
in Torres Straits, they are a stout, tall, athletic race of
men,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1149src" href="#xd27e1149" name=
"xd27e1149src">15</a> and as hairy on the face and body as Europeans,
with long hair, and <i>without</i> the negro cast of countenance. This
race may be traced by intervals to Ternate, Gilolo, &amp;c., where they
are called Harraforas;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1155src" href=
"#xd27e1155" name="xd27e1155src">16</a> but none are found in the
Phillippines (unless the Ylocos have some relationship to them). Is not
the native of New Ireland and Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Islands too of
this race?<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1205src" href="#xd27e1205" name=
"xd27e1205src">17</a> The difference between them is most striking. The
one are dwarfish negroes, the others almost black Europeans. Both are
essentially different from the Malay family, and not only so, but from
each other (the <i>native</i> of Amboyna, I think, forms the link
between them) and this difference is apparently anatomical, in the
shape of the skull, facial angles, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">We are as yet in the infancy of our knowledge
of the origin of these various families of the human race: like that of
languages, it will in all probability remain one more of conjecture
than of fact; but it is still a subject of deep interest. I have heard
from respectable authority, that the language of Cagayan, the most
northern province but one of the island of Luzon, the men of which are
tail, stout, olive-coloured, almost beardless, and proverbial for their
mildness, peaceable behaviour, and fidelity, so much resembles that of
the Sandwich islanders, that some of these at Manila found no
difficulty in making the Cagayan servants understand them! The province
of Ylocos is the next to this to the north, and forms the north coast
of the island. The Ylocos are black, short-bearded men, and noted for
their insubordination and dissipated character.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

writer of this memoir has, on the coast of New Holland, between Cape
Capricorn and Endeavour Straits, had occasion to know this fact. A
party of these savages attacked the captain and supercargo of a vessel

The account of them given by the supercargo, and indeed by all the
party attacked, uniformly agreed in describing them as the finest made

term &ldquo;Haraforas&rdquo; is applied to the Subanos of Mindanao by
Captain Forrest; from his <i lang="fr">Voyage</i>, pp. 266, 268, 271,
273, 278&ndash;282, we obtain the following interesting and first-hand
information about that people:</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;The vassals of the Sultan, and of
others, who possess great estates, are called Kanakan. Those vassals
are sometimes Mahometans, though mostly Haraforas [&ldquo;who are also
called Subanos, or Oran Manubo,&rdquo; p. 186]. The latter only may be
sold with the lands, but cannot be sold off the lands. The Haraforas
are more opprest than the former. The Mahometan vassals are bound to
accompany their lords, on any sudden expedition; but the Haraforas
being in a great measure excused from such attendance, pay yearly
certain taxes, which are not expected from the Mahometan vassals. They
pay a boiss, or land tax. A Harafora family pays ten battels of paly
(rough rice) forty lb. each; three of rice, about sixty lb.; one fowl,
one bunch of plantains, thirty roots, called clody, or St. Helena yam,
and fifty heads of Indian corn. I give this as one instance of the
utmost that is ever paid. Then they must sell fifty battels of paly,
equal to two thousand pound weight, for one kangan. So at Dory, or New
Guinea, one prong, value half a dollar, or one kangan, given to a
Harafora, lays a perpetual tax on him. Those vassals at Magindano have
what land they please; and the Mahometans on the sea coast, whether
free or kanakan, live mostly by trading with the Haraforas, while their
own gardens produce them betel nuts, coco nuts, and greens. They seldom
grow any rice, and they discourage as far as they can, the Haraforas
from going to Mindano, to sell the produce of their plantations. On the
banks of the Pelangy and Tamantakka, the Mahometans grow much rice. The
boiss is not always collected in fruits of the earth only. A
tax-gatherer, who arrived at Coto Intang, when I was there, gave me the
following list of what he had brought from some of Rajah Moodo&rsquo;s
crown lands, being levied on perhaps five hundred families. 2870
battels of paly, of forty lb. each; 490 Spanish dollars; 160 kangans; 6
tayls of gold, equal to 30 l [sterling]; 160 Malons: a cloth made of
the plantain tree, three yards long, and one broad. This last mentioned
cloth is the usual wear of the country women, made in the form of a
Bengal lungy, or Buggess [<i>i.e.</i>, Bugis] cloth, being a wide sack
without a bottom; and is often used as a currency in the market. The
currency in most parts of the country, is the Chinese kangan, coarse
cloth, thinly woven, nineteen inches broad, and six yards long; the
value at Sooloo is ten dollars for a bundle of twenty-five sealed up;
and at Magindano much the same; but at Magindano dollars are scarce.
These bundles are called gandangs, rolled up in a cylindrical form.
They have also, as a currency, kousongs, a kind of nankeen, dyed black;
and kompow, a strong white Chinese linen, made of flax; of which more
particularly hereafter. The kangans generally come from Sooloo; so they
are got at second hand: for the Spaniards have long hindered Chinese
junks, bound from Amoy to Magindano, to pass Samboangan. This is the
cause of so little trade at Magindano, no vessels sailing from Indostan
thither; and the little trade is confined to a few country Chinese,
called Oran Sangly, and a few Soolooans who come hither to buy rice and
paly, bringing with them Chinese articles: for the crop of rice at
Sooloo can never be depended on. In the bazar, or market, the immediate
currency is paly. Ten gantangs of about four pounds each, make a
battel; and three battels (a cylindrical measure, thirteen inches and
five-tenths high; the same in diameter) about one hundred and twenty
pounds of paly, are commonly sold for a kangan. Talking of the value of
things here, and at Sooloo, they say, such a house or prow, &amp;c., is
worth so many slaves; the old valuation being one slave for thirty
kangans. They also specify in their bargains, whether is meant matto
(eye) kangan, real kangan, or nominal kangan. The dealing in the
nominal, or imaginary kangan, is an ideal barter. When one deals for
the real kangans, they must be examined; and the gandangs, or bundles
of twenty-five pieces, are not to be trusted, as the dealers will often
forge a seal, having first packed up damaged kangans. In this the
Chinese here, and at Sooloo, are very expert. The China cash at
Magindano, named pousin, have holes as in China. I found them scarce;
their price is from one hundred and sixty to one hundred and eighty for
a kangan. At Sooloo is coined a cash of base copper, called petis, of
which two hundred, down to one hundred and seventy, go for a
kangan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;On Sooloo are no Haraforas. The
Haraforas on Magindano make a strong cloth, not of cotton, but of a
kind of flax, very like what the Batta people wear on the coast of
Sumatra.&rdquo; &ldquo;One day near Tubuan, a Harafora brought down
some paddy from the country: I wanted to purchase it; but the head man
of the village, a Magindanoer, would not permit him to sell it me. I
did not dispute the point; but found afterwards, the poor Harafora had
sold about three hundred pounds of paly for a prong, or chopping
knife.&rdquo; &ldquo;They all seem to be slaves to the Magindano
people: for these take what they please, fowls or anything in the house
they like best; and if the owners seem angry, threaten to tie them up,
and flog them.&rdquo; &ldquo;The inhabitants of this country [of the
Illanos] have generally their name from the lake [<i>i.e.</i>, Lake
Lanao] on which they reside. The inlanders dwell chiefly towards the
East, where are said to be thirty thousand men, intermixed in many
places with the Haraforas, who seem to be the primitives of the island.
On the north coast of Magindano, the Spaniards have had great success,
in converting to Christianity those Haraforas. Their agreeing in one
essential point, the eating of hog&rsquo;s flesh, may, in a great
measure, have paved the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;The Magindano people sell to the
Haraforas iron chopping knives, called prongs, cloth, salt, &amp;c.,
for their rice and other fruits of the earth. For the Haraforas dread
going to sea, else they could carry the produce of their lands to a
better market. They are much imposed on, and kept under by their
Mahometan lords; and are all tributary to the Sultan, or to some Rajah
Rajah (noblemen) under him. Their system proves thus the feudal.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Haraforas are thinly scattered; and, being all tributary,
many together seldom stay long at one place. This cannot be for want of
water, pasture, or fertile ground; as with the Tartars on the continent
of Asia. On this island, almost every spot is covered either with
timber, brushwood, reeds, or grass; and streams are found every where
in abundance. Nor can it be to avoid wild beasts; there are none on the
island: a good cause why deer, wild horses and other wild cattle are
found in so many parts of it. I suspect that the Haraforas are often so
opprest that some have wisely got inland, beyond the
tax-gatherer&rsquo;s ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Evidently Forrest and the writer of the
<i>Remarks</i> had in mind two different peoples, to whom they applied
the term Haraforas. Crawfurd explains this name (<i>Dictionary Ind.
Islands</i>, p. 10) as a corruption of <i>Alforas</i>; it is &ldquo;not
a native word at all, nor is it the generic name of any people
whatsoever. It is a word of the Portuguese language, apparently derived
from the Arabic article <i>al</i>, and the preposition <i>fora</i>,
&lsquo;without.&rsquo; The Indian Portuguese applied it to all people
beyond their own authority, or who were not subdued by them, and
consequently to the wild races of the interior. It would seem to be
equivalent to the &lsquo;Indios bravos&rsquo; of the Spaniards, as
applied to the wild and unconquered tribes of America and the
Philippines.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Eds.</span>&nbsp;<a class=

&ldquo;At Manila, therefore, a doctor [of law] is a species of
phenomenon, and many years pass without one of them being seen; in two
universities there is no doctor, while in 1767 there was but one
competitor for the doctoral of the cathedral. Yet it must be noted that
this competitor was a Mexican, and was not born in Manila. Of what use,
therefore, are two universities in this city? Would not a single one be
more than enough? One who knows Latin is greatly esteemed in Manila,
because that language is not common there, in spite of the two
universities which I have just mentioned; what is learned in those
institutions is very poor, and is only imperfectly understood. When I
arrived there, a great many persons asked me if I knew Latin, and when
I answered that I knew a little of it they apparently had after that
more respect for me. All the ancient prejudices of the schools seem to
have abandoned us of Europe only to take refuge at Manila, where
certainly they have long remained, for the ancient doctrine is there in
too good hands to give place to sound ideas of physics. Don Feliciano
Marqu&eacute;s often honestly confessed to me that in Spain they were a
hundred years behind France, in the sciences; and that at Manila they
were a hundred years behind Spain. One can judge, by that, of the
present state of physics at Manila, in the midst of two universities.
In that city electricity is known only by name, and the Holy Office of
the Inquisition has prohibited experiments in that line. I knew there a
Frenchman, a surgeon by profession, a man of parts and of inquiring
mind, who was threatened with the Inquisition for having tried to make
such experiments; but I think that what really drew upon him this
ill-fortune was the experiment of the &ldquo;little friar.&rdquo; [This
simple experiment in physics was made with a little figure resembling a
friar; it had never before been seen in Manila, and everybody ran to
look at it and laugh.] &ldquo;This experiment of the surgeon, who made
his little friar dance, and sometimes sink to the bottom of the vial by
way of correcting him, drew upon him the displeasure of the entire body
of religious with whom Manila swarms; there was talk of the Holy
Office, and it was said that the surgeon&rsquo;s experiment was a case
for the Inquisition. The surgeon, therefore&mdash;whose only intention
in the experiment was to vex the friars who had prevented him from
making his experiments in electricity&mdash;was compelled to cease his
pleasantry, and Manila had to express its detestation of the pleasure
that it had taken in seeing the experiment.&rdquo; [The author was
visited by many people at his observatory, who desired to see the sun
and the planets through his telescope;] &ldquo;the women were even more
curious than the men about the rare things which I showed them, and
which I took pleasure in explaining to them; but not a single religious
came to visit my observatory.&rdquo; (Le Gentil, <i lang=

following statements regarding the native character are made by Ramon
Reyes Lala (<i>The Philippine Islands</i>, New York, 1899, pp.
80&ndash;87), himself a Filipino: &ldquo;The first thing that in the
native character impresses the traveler is his impassive demeanor and
imperturbable bearing. He is a born stoic, a fatalist by nature. This
accounts for his coolness in moments of danger, and his intrepid
bearing against overwhelming odds. This feature of the Malay character
has often been displayed in the conflicts of the race with the
Europeans in the East Indies. Under competent leadership the native,
though strongly averse to discipline, can be made a splendid soldier.
As sailors, too, I do not believe they can be equaled.&rdquo; &ldquo;As
a result of the stoicism of the native character, he never bewails a
misfortune, and has no fear of death.&rdquo; &ldquo;Europeans often
seem to notice in them what they deem a lack of sympathy for the
misfortunes of others; but it is not this so much as resignation to the
inevitable.&rdquo; &ldquo;The educated native, however, impregnated
with the bitter philosophy of the civilized world, is by no means so
imperturbable. While more keenly alive to the sufferings of others, he
is also more sensitive to his own sorrows.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Incomprehensible inconsistencies obtain in nearly every native.
Students of character may, therefore, study the Filipinos for years,
and yet, at last, have no definite impression of their mental or moral
status. Of course, those living in the cities are less baffling to the
physiognomist and the ethnologist; for endemic peculiarities have been
so rubbed off or modified that the racial traits are not obvious. But
observe the natives, in their primitive abodes, where civilizing forces
have not penetrated! You will then be amazed at the extraordinary
mingling and clashing of antithetical characteristics in one and the
same person; uncertain as to whether the good or the bad may be
manifested. Like the wind, the mood comes and goes, and no one can tell
why. I myself, with all the inherited feelings, tastes, and tendencies
of my countrymen&mdash;modified and transmuted [by his education and
long residence in Europe and America], happily&mdash;have stood aghast
or amused at some hitherto unknown characteristic manifesting itself in
an intimate acquaintance; and after I had been for years, too, wholly
ignorant of his being so possessed or obsessed. And after that, the
same mental or moral squint would be displayed at irregular
intervals.&rdquo; &ldquo;His indolence is the result of generations of
tropical ancestors. Besides, deprived by the Spaniards from all active
participation in affairs of the Government, and robbed of the fruits of
industry, all incentive to advancement and progress was taken away. He
therefore yields with composure to the crushing conditions of his
environment, preferring the lazy joys of indolence rather than labor
for the benefit of his oppressors. Naturally. Recent events, however,
show that, given the stimulant of hope, even the &lsquo;indolent
natives&rsquo; of the Philippines can achieve and nobly dare. Some
Spaniards also have asserted that the Filipinos are naturally disloyal
and treacherous, and that their word is not to be depended on. Now, the
whole world knows that they have every reason to be disloyal to the
Spaniard, who has for centuries so cruelly oppressed them. The devotion
to the cause of freedom, however, which has recently made Rizal and
hundreds of others martyrs to Spanish cruelty, shows that they also
have the stuff that heroes are made of, and that they ran be loyal to
an animating principle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Though calm, the native is not
secretive, but often loquacious. He is naturally curious and
inquisitive, but always polite, and respectful withal&mdash;especially
to his superiors. He is passionate, and, in common with all
half-civilized races, is cruel to his foes. The quality of mercy, like
the sentiment&mdash;as distinguished from the passion&mdash;of love, is
perhaps more the product of the philosophy of civilization than a
natural attribute of the human heart.&rdquo; &ldquo;All travelers unite
in attributing to the natives extreme family affection. They are very
fond of their children; who, as a rule, are respectful and
well-behaved. The noisy little hoodlums of European and American cities
are utterly unknown. The old are tenderly cared for, and venerated;
while in almost every well-to-do household are one or two poor
relatives who, while mere hangers-on, are nevertheless made welcome to
the table of their host. Indeed, the hospitality of the Filipinos is
proverbial. A guest is always welcome, and welcome to the best. As a
rule, the people are superstitious and very credulous; but how could
they be otherwise? For three hundred years they have been denied even
the liberty of investigation; when no light, save the dim glimmer of
priestcraft pierced the utter darkness of their lot. Those that have
been educated, however, have proved apt converts&mdash;only too apt,
say the priests and the Spaniards&mdash;to the conclusions of science
and of modern research. The native is rarely humorous, and seldom
witty. He is not easily moved to anger, and when angry does not often
show it. When he does, like the Malay of Java, he is prone to lose all
control of himself, and, with destructive energy, slays all in his
path. This is infrequent, however, but is a contingency that may occur
at any time. If a native has been unjustly punished, he will never
forget it, and will treasure the memory of his wrong until a good
opportunity for revenge presents itself. Like all courageous people, he
despises cowardice and pusillanimity. He has, therefore, but little
regard for the meek and humble Chinaman, who will pocket an insult
rather than avenge himself. He greatly esteems the European, who is
possessed of the qualities which he admires, and will follow him into
the very jaws of death. He is easily awed by a demonstration of
superior force, and is ruled best by mild but firm coercion, based upon
justice. He is not often ambitious, save socially, and to make some
display, being fond of ceremony and of the pomp and glitter of a
procession. He is sober, patient, and always clean. This can be said of
few peoples. He easily adjusts himself to new conditions, and will soon
make the best of their surroundings. As servants they are honest,
obedient, and will do as they are told. It must be said that they enjoy
litigation more than is good for them or for the best interests of the
colony. There must be some psychological reason for this. It doubtless
gives some play to the subtlety of the Oriental mind. It is said that
he lacks the sense of initiative, and to some extent this may be true.
The recent conduct of Aguinaldo&mdash;a full-blooded
native&mdash;proves, notwithstanding, that he is not wholly deficient
in aggressiveness nor in organizing power.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Lala adds (pp. 157, 158): &ldquo;I have talked

this: to be always shut up, in a climate so hot, eating scanty and poor

these causes make the brain grow hot, and madness follows. Nearly all

<p class="footnote cont">Comyn gives similar tables for the production
of indigo and rice, estimating the net profit thereon at 57 and 60 per
cent respectively. He adds, on the margin of the sheet: &ldquo;In
favorable years the profit of the grower is wont to increase in an
extraordinary manner. The 4,000 shoots of sugar-cane, for instance,
yield him 3 tareas, or 28 loaves of sugar, in place of the 14 loaves
which were figured in the comparative estimate preceding; the cavan of
seed yields 80 and even 100 cavans of rice in the hull, in place of the
35 computed; and he obtains a quintal of indigo from 15, or even from
10, <i>balsadas</i>, instead of 25 being necessary for furnishing the
said product. And if the grower is fairly well-to-do, so that he can
send his produce to the general market, and sell it to the foreign
merchants or ship-captains who come for these products, he can obtain
incomparably more for them than by delivering them upon the ground to
the middlemen. At Manila I have seen indigo from La Laguna sold at the
rate of 130 pesos a quintal for extra fine grade, and at 100 pesos for
the usual quality; sugar, at 4p. 5r. a loaf; and palay (or rice in the
hull) at 3 pesos; but I have preferred to limit myself to a low rate in
the selling price which I have assigned to the aforesaid products in
the preceding estimates, in order to demonstrate more thoroughly the
advantages which agriculture offers in Filipinas, and at the same time
to conform to practical experience in the formation of estimates of
this sort.&rdquo; Cf. similar estimates by Mallat (<i>Philippines</i>,

man of high spirit, and one of the few Spaniards in Manila who are an

when accompanied only by a piquet of infantry. The robber knew him, and
with a gallantry worthy of a better cause, defied him to single combat!
With true chivalric spirit, the challenge was instantly accepted; and
orders given to the piquet not to interfere on pain of their lives. A
desperate conflict ensued, in which the gallant Spaniard was at length
victorious, and the robber&rsquo;s head was sent through the country in
triumph. Shall the sequel be told? When he returned to Manila, with the
blessing of every honest native for having cleared that part of the
country of robbers, a subject of prosecution was found in this service
by those numerous enemies which every honest man has in a country like
this, and on some frivolous pretext of having (<i>unavoidably</i>)
fired into a cottage, and killed or wounded some innocent persons. He
could not stoop to flatter or bribe; and it was with the utmost

Something of this is more or less visible in the colonial policy of

have acted on the broad and liberal principle of &ldquo;<span lang=

wealth is, there is my country&rdquo;] (a humiliating but correct
estimate, not only of the bulk of colonial adventurers, but of mankind
in general), will scarcely be questioned. The Havannah is a splendid
example. In 1780, strangers were rigorously prohibited, or at least
loaded with restrictions; an enormous smuggling trade was carried on,
and the island did not pay its own expenses. In 1820, when the
prohibitory system had been long annihilated, and strangers allowed
free intercourse and establishment, its trade had increased a
hundred-fold; and not only did it suffice for its own, much more
expensive establishments; but, both directly and indirectly,
contributed large sums to the mother country, though at the first
epoch, the profits on colonial capital were at least 30 per cent. more
than at the last.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

&ldquo;Ecclesiastical foundations and obras p&iacute;as were, it may be
said, innumerable. From the richest city to the smallest village, from
one extreme of the Peninsula to the other, and even to the farthest
boundaries which the monarchy reached in the period of its greatest
grandeur, the acts of Christian piety are seen in various foundations.
These include not only hermitages, confraternities, memorials,
charitable foundations, and chaplaincies,&mdash;which by themselves
alone made a total of enormous wealth&mdash;but more pretentious
establishments, as convents, cathedrals, parish churches, and colleges;
and any person will be surprised at those which were supported by some
towns which in their present condition are reduced in population and
poor. Larruga in his memoirs states that Toledo had 25 parish churches
and its cathedral, 39 convents, 14 hospitals, and four colleges, in

the former, and, at the same time, securing to the Emperor the payment

"xd27e2976" href="#xd27e2976src" name="xd27e2976">103</a></span> Dr.
Nathan Allen, in a pamphlet entitled <i>The Opium Trade</i> (Lowell,
Mass., 1853), presents a history of this traffic, describes its results
in both China and India, and protests against its continuance. He
states that opium, originally a native of Persia, spread thence into
Turkey and India, being cultivated more extensively in the latter
country than anywhere else in the world. In 1767 the British East India
Company formed the plan of sending opium from Bengal to China, where
but little of this drug had previously been sold; but they had little
success in this until 1794, when they began a traffic which lasted some
twenty-five years at the ports of Whampoa and Macao. In 1821, the opium
merchants abandoned these places, on account of difficulties
encountered in their trade, and centered it at Lintin Island, in the
bay at the entrance to Canton River, where it rapidly increased.
&ldquo;Here might be seen large armed vessels reposing, throughout the
year, at anchor, constituting a floating depot of storehouses, for
receiving the opium in large quantities from the ships bringing it from
India, and dealing it out in chests and cases to the Chinese junks, to
be retailed at various points on shore. The Merope, Capt. Parkyns, in
1821, was the first ship that commenced the system of delivering opium
at different cities along the coast of China, and from that time, the
trade increased with wonderful rapidity. Eligible places also on the
east and north-east coast of China were selected to station receiving
vessels, to which the Chinese might easily have access, and become
participators in the trade.&rdquo; Allen cites many contemporary and
high authorities. Among these, James Holman says, in 1830 (<i>Travels
in China</i>, p. 162), that the opium boats &ldquo;are but seldom
interfered with, nor are they likely to be, so long as the <i>Free
Traders</i> can afford to pay the mandarins so much better for not
fighting, than the government will for doing their duty. The use of
opium has become so universal among the people of China, that the laws
which render it penal, and the proclamations which send forth their
daily fulminations against its continuance, have not the slightest
effect in checking the prevalence of so general a habit. Smoking houses
abound in Canton; and the inhabitants of every class who can furnish
themselves with the means to obtain the pipe, are seldom without this
article of general luxury. It is a propensity that has seized upon all
ranks and classes, and is generally on the increase.&rdquo; From the
year 1800, the Chinese government tried to stop this traffic, strictly
prohibiting the importation of opium; but foreign merchants paid no
attention to this, and forced the trade on the Chinese people. In 1839,
a Chinese official destroyed, by command of the emperor, over 20,000
chests (worth $12,000,000) of the drug at Canton; this led to a war
with England, commonly known as &ldquo;the Opium War.&rdquo; The
resulting treaty of peace compelled the Chinese to open five ports to
British trade and residence, to cede the island of Hong-kong to Great
Britain&mdash;at which place the opium trade then centered; and in 1845
the British authorities licensed twenty shops to sell opium at
retail&mdash;and to pay heavy indemnities not only to the English
government and the merchants, but for the opium destroyed, which had
been legally confiscated by the emperor as contraband goods. The
Chinese commissioners objected, but were threatened with renewed
hostilities if they persisted, and they had to yield. During the past
year negotiations looking to a cessation of the opium traffic have been
carried on between Great Britain and China. The following also shows
the recent growth of the drug in China. &ldquo;As for the gums from the
Indias, the Chinese physicians and surgeons make hardly any use of
them. I do not think that in an entire year there is used in Pekin a
half-livre of opium (which they call <i>Yapien</i>); its place is
supplied by using the white poppy.&rdquo; (Father Parennin, in a letter
dated September 20, 1740; <i lang="fr">Lettres &eacute;difiantes</i>,

<p class="first">Most Excellent Sir:</p>
<p>The Filipinas Islands, on account of their great extent, their
advantageous location in the center of the commercial world of Asia,
their considerable population, and the fertility of their
soil&mdash;which is capable of yielding all the products which are
grown between the two tropics&mdash;require from his Majesty&rsquo;s
paternal government a carefully planned system of measures which shall
strengthen their peace and internal security, and at the same time
advance their agriculture, industry, and commerce to that high degree
to which they have been destined by Providence.</p>
<p>As I am charged by order of the king our sovereign to furnish
information regarding the measures which can contribute to objects so
important, it will be my plan to point out (but with that
circumspection which is so necessary in matters of colonial policy and
administration) the causes which today are antagonizing both the
internal and external security of those islands and their successful
administration&mdash;civil, economic, and commercial&mdash;proposing in
regard to each one of these the correctives which have been impressed
upon me by my experience as consulting <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Of the present composition of the divisions of the
army</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The army of the Filipinas Islands, in view of the
class of men of whom it now consists, offers very little (if any) moral
confidence for their resisting the force of the revolutions which may
be formed in the very bosom of the islands. It is officered, in great
part, by Spaniards of the country, and by some Americans and mestizos;
and the disposition, tendencies, and education of the latter class are
(with very rare exceptions) absolutely different from those of the
other and European officers; consequently, there exists between the two
classes, from the outset, a certain insuperable disunion of feeling,
between not only individuals but the two classes. The officer who is a
native of the country has all the lax characteristics which the climate
induces. He lives in exclusive intercourse with his neighbors, and
separated from the Europeans. He likes the military career solely for
the conveniences connected with his office; he is incapable of a noble
emulation, and limits himself in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184"
href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>the service to the outside
and very inexact fulfilment of the necessary obligations of his
position; and when the cause of the legitimate government exacts on his
part sacrifices incompatible with his own interests or those of his
neighbors, he disowns and absolutely abandons his duties. For these
reasons the officers born in that country have never come to merit the
confidence of their chiefs; and if from the rank of cadets they have
been promoted to that of captain, it has been more from the peremptory
necessity of completing the military corps and protecting the service
than on account of their fitness, military spirit, or appreciation of
the confidence and honor which the king bestows on them. Such
sentiments they can never possess until they undergo a rigid training
moral and political, in the colleges of Espa&ntilde;a. This mental
divergence, and the natural contrariety of their temperaments, so
mischievous in the ordinary service of military bodies, are much more
lamentable in the crisis of a revolution. The officers of the country,
being nearer to the Indian soldiers in their customs and language, make
common cause with the latter, and seduce and lead them into their own
faction, with a marvelous readiness; this I have repeatedly seen in the
mutinies of military bodies which have occurred in the Americas, and
especially in that of the troops in the kingdom of Guadalajara in the
year &rsquo;21, and in that at Manila in the year &rsquo;23.</p>
<p>The army of Filipinas also contains a considerable number of Indian
sergeants and corporals, and this is another of the causes from which
have already arisen, and always will arise, seditions in the corps.
Whoever has observed the natural disposition of the Filipino Indian
will recognize two things: First, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185"
href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>that he always imitates and
obeys only that which is directly commanded, explained, and taught to
him; and, second, that while he is kept in his simple condition of
laborer, artisan, or soldier he is entirely void of ambition. The
Indian soldier serves very contentedly during the eight years of his
term, and returns to his own land without aspiring to anything; but
when he is placed in command, of any degree whatever, he is filled with
pride, and vehemently desires to be at the head [<i lang="es">serlo
todo</i>], without changing, for all that, his station as an Indian.
[The writer states that even these non-commissioned officers were
formerly always Spaniards;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3388src" href=
"#xd27e3388" name="xd27e3388src">1</a>] the appointment of Indians to
these posts has been only in these last years, in which a system of
commerce which entirely separated those islands from their center of
government has rendered impossible the despatch of re&euml;nforcements,
so necessary to those islands. From that very time may be noted much
laxity in the military service and discipline; and I have witnessed the
insurrections and disorders which never were known in former days. In
the popular uprisings in the suburbs of Manila, at the end of
1820,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3391src" href="#xd27e3391" name=
"xd27e3391src">2</a> the detachments commanded by Indian corporals who
were sent out to pacify the villages took such part in the lawlessness
that they even attacked houses, and it was by their gunshots that many
foreigners were butchered. In the military insurrection of June 3,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>1823, parties of troops commanded by only one
officer (a Philippine Spaniard), without any previous plan or any
combination, and simply by appearing before the barracks of their
regiment and offering to make captains of the Indian sergeants,
immediately persuaded them to revolt; and, directing the soldiers at
their own pleasure, they committed the lamentable and horrible acts of
that day, which ought to be kept well in mind. [This should be a
warning against allowing the Indians any place of command, especially
as they have more influence with the common soldiers than do the
superior officers; and all military posts of command should be filled
with competent and trained Spaniards. The writer urges the following
measures of reform: (1) that a sufficient number of Spanish officers to
fill all the posts of sergeant and corporal, and a surplus number to
fill vacancies as they occur, shall be sent to Filipinas annually; (2)
the class of cadets should be suppressed, who &ldquo;have always been
(with a few exceptions) very unsatisfactory officers; for, belonging to
very poor and obscure families, and receiving no kind of education, in
a country which so depraves and corrupts a youth, they demoralize the
soldiers, and cause the military career to be held there in slight
esteem;&rdquo; (3) in future, no other officers except the heads of
corps should be sent there from the Peninsula, so as to make room for
promoting the lower officers, and to avoid demoralizing the young
Spaniards; (4) that the Indian and mestizo sergeants or corporals who,
after fulfilling their twelve years of all service, have to be replaced
by Spaniards, shall be given places in the custom-house or revenue
service, or in the monopoly shops, so as to recompense them for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>losing their posts.] In this manner the Indian
soldier&mdash;who is docile, and always imitates the desires and
opinions of his immediate superiors&mdash;will receive more
disinterested treatment than he has hitherto had; he will make common
cause with his leaders, in critical cases of popular revolutions; and
the army will remain loyal and incorrupt in its opinions, always ready
for its duty, and united in action and interests.</p>

islands</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The colonies are governed and maintained more by
opinion, justice and example than by force of arms. When opinion in
them becomes corrupted up to the point of forming great conspiracies,
the offensive action of the army produces no other effect than to
hasten the ruin of the legitimate government. [In the Filipinas
Islands, the persuasions and example of the ministers of religion, and
the measures taken by the civil authorities, have been usually
sufficient to put down an uprising; but it is not well to rely too much
on military force in such cases, since such action causes rankling
resentment and unites the discontented in the common effort to throw
off the yoke. It is impossible, in such a climate, to employ only
Spaniards in the army, since they cannot endure it, and the expense of
such an army would also be too great a burden on the royal treasury.]
The army of Filipinas, then, ought not to have a greater force than is
sufficient to defend and maintain, in any event, a post or locality
that is impregnable, which can serve as a protection and defense to the
government, its interests and employees, and the families of Spanish
blood. A center of strength, ordered and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>disciplined, of this
sort (the locality of which I will mention later), will be inaccessible
not only to three millions of inhabitants who now people the islands,
but to thirty millions who might inhabit them; and this idea alone in
the mind of the Filipino Indian is the most efficacious for
disconcerting, in its origin or progress, any plan for conspiring or
taking by surprise. [In such a point of vantage, the government can use
measures of policy,] which in revolutions are more effective than arms
for re&euml;stablishing order, without leaving in the minds of the
people, as war does, deep feelings of resentment at being repressed;
and the partial revolutions in the provinces will be always
broken&mdash;as thus far have been those of Ilocos, Ceb&uacute;,
<span class="corr" id="xd27e3407" title="Source: Batan">Bataan</span>,
and others&mdash;by the zeal and sagacity of the European religious and
co&ouml;peration of the civil employees of the king. In such a crisis,
the principle is, to disunite sagaciously the opinions and feelings of
the people; and repression by force only unites them. [If the military
forces, the forts, and the navy be augmented, the only results will be
to demoralize the army, make unnecessary display of the
government&rsquo;s power, teach the Indians the art of war (which as
few of them as possible ought to know), and impose unendurable burdens
on the treasury. Plans of this sort ought to be postponed until the
country can bear such burdens. The present permanent veteran force of
the islands seems to Bernaldez sufficient for the above purpose;] it
consists of four battalions of infantry, each containing approximately
one thousand men; of a cavalry corps, recently increased to three
squadrons; and a brigade of artillery, with a force of four hundred
forty-four men, including a light-armed company. The following
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>may also be regarded as permanent troops: a
company, called the Pampanga, annexed to the service of the engineer
corps; and three brigades called the &ldquo;pirate marines&rdquo;
[<i lang="es">marina corsaria</i>], who have been in service twenty
years. [The system of rewards is costly and useless. The soldier
receives enough pay to live comfortably, in a country where living is
so cheap; &ldquo;it is equivalent for an Indian, and even for a
Spaniard, to three times the same amount in Europa.&rdquo; The rewards
given to the soldiers ought to be reduced in such measure as the
circumstances of the colony demand, &ldquo;taking for a basis the fact
that with four hard dollars a month any inferior employee can maintain
himself and all his family comfortably in the provinces, and that all
beyond that is extravagance.&rdquo; The Pampanga company has no
organization; it ought to be placed on a military basis, with European
officers, and ranked as a company of pioneers, when it would be very
useful in the service. The militia troops of the islands have been
neglected, although they are (especially the pirate marines) so
important in checking the Moro pirates. The commanders are &ldquo;men
of no force, arbitrarily chosen by the governor there, from the class
of merchants and private citizens of Manila, who possess only honorary
titles, without any military instruction or love for the military
career.&rdquo; The militia forces do not cost the government much, but
they are of very little use. Bernaldez thinks that the pirate marines
ought to be regarded as a part of the regular army, with the same pay,
and with European officers. The cavalry corps of Luzon is untrained,
and would be of little use in an invasion of the country; it ought to
be replaced by light and irregular cavalry, and supplemented
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>by a small body of veterans. Two squadrons in
the corps of dragoons of Luzon would be sufficient to preserve order in
Manila, and the third ought to be abolished as unnecessary.]</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the artillery and its dependent
branches</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The artillery corps is in better condition than any
other part of the military force of the islands; it is under better
discipline, and has always been under European officers. The Indians
are in great terror of the cannon. When in the tumult of 1820 Folgueras
ordered three pieces to be planted at various points outside the walls,
the natives implored him to take the cannon away, as the inhabitants
were so terrified that they did not dare to cross the streets; and in
the disturbances of 1809 in Ilocos, &ldquo;only one four-libra cannon,
fired by a revenue-clerk, the ball from which hit a church-tower, was
sufficient to curb and disconcert more than 10,000 insurgents.&rdquo;
To this corps might be added (but as footmen) the company which should
be disbanded in the cavalry, since in so rough and broken a country as
Luzon horsemen are of little use. The artillery in Manila is of
wretched quality: almost all of it was cast there, at various periods,
and by unskilled founders; not only the guns but their carriages are
irregular, clumsy, unreliable, and are difficult to manage; and for
these very reasons the foundry there has been abolished, but since that
time no cannon save a small siege battery has been sent thither from
Europe. The artillery cast in Manila is sufficiently good to provide
for the defense of the provinces against the Moros; but measures should
be taken to provide for the better defense of that city. The working of
iron and the making of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>artillery are almost entirely in
the hands of the Chinese of Manila,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3425src"
href="#xd27e3425" name="xd27e3425src">3</a> and the Indians therefore
are unskilled in this industry; some skilled masters should be sent
over from Spain to teach them and oversee the manufacture of iron. The
country abounds in rich mines of iron, but these have been barely
scratched and then abandoned; only some common utensils are made there,
and other iron articles are sold to the people at high prices by
foreigners, who carry great sums of money out of the country.
&ldquo;The iron of Manila has been examined in the artillery workshops,
and has been found to be very soft and fibrous.&rdquo; Attempts have
been made by the Spanish government to utilize the mines and introduce
machinery into their operation; but the officials entrusted with these
enterprises have been ineffective, caring only to draw their salaries.
Bernaldez urges the encouragement of private capital to undertake these
works, with concessions, privileges, and protection which shall be
adequate to enlist their energies; this would lead to the development
of the natural riches of the islands, the population would be increased
by skilled artisans and mechanics, and the great increase thus obtained
in wealth of the country would likewise <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>bring incalculable
benefits to the royal treasury&mdash;not only in revenues from the
increased commerce and manufactures, but in the great saving in the
expenses of furnishing the army with weapons, made in the country at so
much less cost than before. In the arsenal reform is needed; all its
workmen except the gunsmiths should be replaced gradually by Indians,
who are so skilful and work for less wages than the Spaniards; and the
gunsmiths should have a regular military organization. Better provision
should also be made for a supply of gunpowder. At the beginning of the
century, a powder factory was erected, which cost eighty thousand hard
dollars, although it was made of only bamboo and nipa; with this a
large supply of powder was made, but its quality was poor, on account
of the impurities in the saltpetre, which they had to obtain from
India. There has been talk of building another factory (the former one
being apparently no longer in existence); it is likely to be as costly
an enterprise, because the lack of a strong current in the rivers
&ldquo;has rendered impracticable the installation of hydraulic
machinery.&rdquo; The Spanish government ought to take measures to
provide the large amount of powder needed for the use of the forts,
army, navy, and revenue service. Bernaldez advises that this be done by
making contracts (with either Spaniards or foreigners), by which they
can secure powder of better quality and at lower prices; and besides
this they ought to send immediately to the islands a scientist (whose
salary ought to be paid from the funds of the Economic Society and the
consulate of commerce)&mdash;&ldquo;whose mission shall be not only to
establish in the capital a chair of mineralogy (which is so necessary
for exploring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>the hitherto unknown interior of the islands),
but himself to make researches in the provinces of the archipelago for
places where the saltpetre can be found&mdash;which he will find,
without fail.&rdquo; Then gunpowder can be made in the islands, and
they will be independent in the means for their defense.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No location like that of Manila could have been
selected by the conquistadors of the island of Luzon for fortifying
themselves and founding the capital of an infant colony. [Its position
is described, with mention of its earlier fortifications; but these
were only suitable for the defense of its inhabitants against piratical
attacks. Its present condition is a dangerous one, for its
fortifications are unable to withstand a siege by European troops; it
has no bomb-proof magazine, and hostile batteries across the Pasig
River could easily reduce the city to ashes. Manila is not suitable for
a military center, and the efforts of the government ought to be bent
toward the fortification of Cavite, which would render that place a
first-class fortress; its advantages for this are enumerated in detail,
and the measures which should be taken to render it impregnable.] The
feeble fortifications of Manila and its citadel may be preserved for
the present, in order to shelter the government and the property of the
Spaniards from a sedition; but in case of war and the landing of an
enemy let them be abandoned and destroyed, in order to proceed for
safety to the impregnable point of Cavite. In this manner will be laid
the foundation for the perpetual security of the [Spanish] government
in those islands, and for their preservation against all enemies,
whether within or without. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the piracies of the Moros</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Longer tolerance of the piratical raids by the Moros
is another cause which in time must compromise our secure possession of
the islands, through the plundering of their maritime villages and the
captivity of their inhabitants, and the stoppage of the commerce and
the coasting trade. Much more is this true because some ports of the
islands, which are in the possession of those pirates, are already
frequented by foreign vessels, which provide the pirates with military
supplies and firearms; and it is to be feared that later the foreigners
will furnish them with plans, vessels, leaders, and other aids, like
those which they have furnished to the disaffected peoples in the
Americas, to wage steady war on the Spanish government. [The Spanish
colony has carried on defensive warfare with the Moros ever since the
conquest, but has gained no permanent advantage therein, while the
enemy have increased in numbers and strength, inflicting ravages on the
southern provinces that are &ldquo;continually greater and more
scandalous.&rdquo; The Spaniards have spent enormous sums in forts,
vessels, and other defenses; but with little effect, on account of the
immense extent of the coasts of Filipinas and the great number of
uninhabited places where the pirates can hide themselves from pursuit.]
Their vessels, called pancos, are of extraordinary swiftness. The Moros
make these of planks lashed together with rattans, without nails or any
[other] ligature. Their masts are three bamboos, their rigging a few
pieces of rattan or the bark of trees, their sails are certain
<i>petates</i>, or mats, which they call <i>saguran</i>; and their
provisions are reduced to the flour made from a tree, called
<i>yoro</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, sago] and dried <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>shellfish. Nearly all
their pancos have two banks of oars, and two men for each oar. And with
this slight though warlike equipment, with their harpoons, javelins,
campilans, and arrows (in handling which weapons they are very
dextrous), and with their swarming crews&mdash;composed of their
slaves, who row under the lash; and of a multitude of pirates, who thus
make their living, and traffic in their booty&mdash;they attack, among
many, with the odds on their side, surround, and jump aboard, any
Christian vessel which cannot defend itself on account of a small crew
or the inaccurate firing of its cannon. [If they are caught in some bay
by the Spanish who pursue them, they abandon their pancos, hide in the
mountains, where they find enough to live on, and, as soon as the
Spaniards depart, the pirates easily construct new boats and resume
their raids. The pirate marine with the forts, troops, and cannon
supported by the Spaniards make a heavy burden of expense on the
treasury and on the people; and the amount thus spent in half a dozen
years is enough to equip a strong naval expedition which could humble
the insolence of the pirates. In view of this, and of the importance of
Jol&oacute;&mdash;which is the headquarters of the Moro pirates and of
their government, and the general market for the Christian slaves and
property which they carry away&mdash;Bernaldez advocates the immediate
conquest of that island, and its repopulation from the more thickly
settled parts of the northern islands. This can easily be done.
Thousands of families whose members have been enslaved, especially in
Bohol, are ready to join such an expedition, if leaders and provisions
are supplied to them; and there are a multitude of skilled inter-island
pilots&mdash;mestizos <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>who are efficient and
rich&mdash;who would act as leaders for the sake of their own profit
and reward in such an enterprise. For ships they could use the
government armed vessels, and the multitude of boats which ply among
the islands; and sufficient rewards could be furnished to the soldiers
in the distribution of the conquered lands and of the plunder which
they would obtain. By this plan, the Moro piracies could be suppressed,
and the islands thus gain peace from those fierce enemies.]</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the large Indian villages</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although the laws of the Indias endeavor to establish
firmly the peace and good government, both temporal and spiritual, of
the villages by placing limits to their extent and the number of their
residents, the inattention of the governors of Filipinas in regard to
this so important subject, on the one hand, and on the other the
interested motives of the parish curas and the ministers of the
doctrinas, have given rise to the abuse of the villages of excessive
size which are now found established in Filipinas. These, as they
cannot be properly governed by their respective local authorities,
maintain within themselves a source of internal civil discord, and from
time to time they have broken out in disturbances which have placed the
islands in a very critical situation.</p>
<p>If the reports of their population be examined, it will be found
that in a great number of villages it does not fall below 10,000,
11,000, or 12,000 souls; and it is impossible that so many can be well
directed spiritually by the one parish cura alone which each village
has, or in secular matters by only one gobernadorcillo or alcalde. In
this class of towns the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href=
"#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>notable are the following: Tondo,
with 13,424 souls; Binondoc, 22,570; Tambobo, 21,378; Pasig, 14,465;
Malolos, 19,655; Vigan, 17,320; Pavay, 14,840; Lavag [Laoag], 25,242;
Bacarra, 13,064; Balayan, 18,631; Taal, 23,526; Banan, 17,438;
Batangas, 19,566; Cabatuan, 17,359; Xaro, 14,911. In these populations
which do not conform to the rule there has always been recognized more
or less instability, for the class of the plebeians, or
<i>caylianes</i>, is immense, and out of proportion to that of the
timauas, or nobles; and likewise because the unarmed authority of a
gobernadorcillo must necessarily be vacillating, at the mercy of that
great mass of people, who are easily set in motion by a seditious
person, a few drunkards, or the superstitious tale of some old man.</p>
<p>The successive revolts of various towns in the province of Ilocos in
the years 1810, 1812, and 1816 had no other source. The cause of this
last uprising was decided by me, in my official character as fiscal of
the royal Audiencia of Manila. In my reply I explained the origin of
those repeated insurrections, analyzed the degree of perverseness which
progressively in each of them had been revealed in the purpose of the
conspirators, and deduced the necessity of dividing the province of
Ilocos into two, to the end that its large towns should each have a
ruler closer at hand who might keep them in check. The Audiencia made a
report, with my opinion as fiscal thereon to the king our sovereign;
and, his Majesty having deigned to command that immediately the said
province should be divided into two, it has been maintained on that
footing, up to the present time, in the greatest order and
tranquillity.</p>
<p>[Even more surprising is the neglect of the governors <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>to
enforce the law that no houses shall be erected close to the castles
and fortresses.] Within cannon-shot of the walls of Manila, and even no
farther away than the breadth of the river, one hundred thousand
souls&mdash;Indians, mestizos, and Chinese&mdash;have been allowed to
establish themselves; a people of foreign origin, in great part,
without passports, classification, settled occupation, or any other
requisite of a well-ordered social condition, and whose formidable
number is threatening Manila with an inevitable blow. The sudden
movements of that great mob of people, ignorant and swayed by blind
passion, reached the point of approaching close to the defenses of the
city, in the year of 1820, even before this was known to the government
and the military council (which for this object had been called
together, and of which I was a member)&mdash;notwithstanding that the
object of their revenge was in the outer suburbs, and that their aim
was not, at least for the time, directed against the city. [These facts
ought to make the authorities of the colony realize that no other
considerations ought to interfere with their prime obligation, which is
to preserve peace and order in the towns and maintain the military
posts in security. Bernaldez recommends that new regulations be formed
regarding the settlements of the islands; that no town be allowed to
contain over five thousand souls and one thousand houses (except the
capitals of the provinces, which might have ten thousand souls and two
thousand houses); that the large towns be divided into villages on the
above basis, which should be kept separate from one another; and that
in the suburbs of Manila there should be more rigorous police control
of the people. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span>Indians there should be classified by
occupations, to each being appointed a chief or leader who should be
responsible for the conduct of those in his class; the use of all
dangerous weapons should be forbidden; passports should be required for
all persons coming from the provinces; and vigilant watch should be
kept over the occupations and mode of life of every family.]</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the titles to landed property belonging to the
Indians and the villages</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The lack of clear and exact laws for properly
authenticating the documents regarding the ownership of the lands of
the Indians, and the uncertain and unlimited possession which the
villages have of lands under the pretext, of their being communal, have
been and always will be in Filipinas the origin of a multitude of
ruinous lawsuits and contentions&mdash;sometimes those of Indians and
villages among themselves, sometimes between these and the Spanish and
mestizo proprietors. The Indians, as a rule, have no title of ownership
in the lands which they possess, and if any one has such it is a
private document, signed by other Indians&mdash;who with the greatest
readiness deny, change, and forge their signatures&mdash;or it will be
simply a writing signed by the alcalde-mayor, a copy of which, if it
remains in the court, will disappear or be mutilated, with equal
readiness, by the Indian clerks of the alcalde, in whose charge the
archives are&mdash;if indeed these are not entirely destroyed in the
frequent fires which occur in the villages. The most common method
which the Indians of the villages have for proving their territorial
property is by tradition, and the depositions of witnesses;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>and with that powerful weapon they undertake and
maintain the most contentious lawsuits, aided by the fiscals of the
Audiencia&mdash;who often forget that their office of defenders of the
Indians is <i>bona fide</i>, and for the sake and protection of the
natives in the tribunals to which the laws commend them. But any person
who may have exercised the duties of magistrate for any time in
Filipinas will know that in the decisions of judges there is nothing
more discredited than the evidence presented by Indian and mestizo
witnesses, who are not restrained from perjury by either an intimate
acquaintance with the obligations of religion or by sentiments of
conscience, honor, and reputation. It is very common to see, in court
cases, that witnesses of that sort will swear, and then contradict
their own testimony, according as the witnesses [are affected by]
either their own interests or the influence of the litigant who
presents them.</p>
<p>These causes, besides rendering the lawsuits of this kind eternal,
have very frequently produced scandalous disobedience of the villagers
to the enactments of the Audiencia of the islands, and uprisings of
armed men in order to prevent effectually even the judicial possession
of the crown lands which had been sold, with all the formalities of the
laws, by the government there; and, finally, they withhold the Spanish
families and persons of wealth from purchasing rural establishments in
order to undertake on a large scale the cultivation of the products of
the country, which is perhaps the only means of promoting the
agriculture of the islands.</p>
<p>It is therefore expedient, in order to cut short these noisy
controversies, which have so mischievous <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>consequences for the
internal peace of the communities in the islands, that his Majesty be
pleased to command that the government there shall oblige all the
villages and private land-owners in them to have authenticated before
the respective alcaldes-mayor of the provinces the documents for their
ownership, both private and communal. Strict obligation should be
imposed on them to surround their lands with trees&mdash;<i lang=

name="xd27e3525src">4</a> mulberry, cotton, cinnamon, cacao&mdash;under
penalty of losing their title to the land. The documents should be
registered in the tribunals of the respective alcaldes, who at the end
of every year should send to the capital the original books of record,
in order that these may be kept there securely in the archives, for
which provision shall be made by the government, not admitting in the
courts or declaring lawful any other titles of ownership to lands than
those which are supported by those necessary conditions.</p>

divide with the religious the opinions of the villagers, who finally,
even though they know the deficient morals of the native priests,
always respect the sacred functions which these exercise. The least
political evil which the latter occasion is [through] their neglect of
their obligations as parish priests, the irregularity of their mode of
life, and their carelessness in everything pertaining to divine
worship. The inhabitants of the villages administered by Indian curas
are very different from those of the religious from Europa, whose
people are distinguished by their simplicity, docility, and religious
training. He who knows the active and leading part played by this class
of persons in accomplishing the independence of America will not be
surprised that in the establishment of the constitution in Filipinas
Indian curas have almost all been the directors of the elections in
their villages, the electors, and the deputies in Cortes and for the
province&mdash;in all these functions distinguishing themselves by
their officiousness, and their pretensions against the legitimate
government of the islands.</p>
<p>This class of persons, dominating the consciences of the ignorant
and unfortunate, can easily drag them into error. As simple farmers and
artisans, they would have been useful to their families and to the
government; but mistakenly raised to the dignity of priests, other
interests now move them, and they form a commonwealth apart in the safe
retreat of the provinces. A consideration of justice wrongly understood
by the prelates of the islands, and a vehement desire in the Indian or
mestizo heads of families to ennoble these by placing their sons in the
priesthood, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>have caused there an excessive ordination of
Indians&mdash;which I cannot avoid characterizing as such, since,
besides the many clerics who are actually administering villages, there
is a considerable surplus of others who are scattered through the
provinces. These evils were foreseen in the laws of the Indias (ley iv,
tit. vii, lib. i), which cautions and exhorts the reverend prelates of
the Indias not to ordain so many clerics as they were doing; but this
has not sufficed, and it is necessary that the government, recognizing
the unfortunate experience that it has already had with this abuse,
should take the most efficacious measures for the purpose of limiting
the authority of the prelates in Filipinas, in conferring
ecclesiastical orders on Indians and mestizos, strictly to the number
of clerics which the religious orders of those islands agree upon and
propose as necessary to have for their coadjutors, and for Indian
villages not now occupied, or which in the future the religious shall
fail to occupy&mdash;ordering the governor of Filipinas to secure, by
mild and discreet means, that the vacant curacies of clerics be
conferred on European religious.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The lack of European religious in the Filipinas
Islands for filling at least four-fifths of their curacies is
incompatible with the permanent preservation of that colony. It can be
safely asserted that the government of his Majesty has in this class of
ministers the most powerful force for maintaining that possession in
attachment to his sovereignty. Their virtuous and unworldly mode of
life; their absolute disinterestedness in regard to temporal matters,
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>is a marvelous contrast to the greed and
ambition of the European trader, the mestizo, and the Chinese; their
extraordinary sacrifices in living apart from the society of their
equals for nineteen, twenty, and [even] thirty years in those almost
uninhabited islands, which are unprovided with the sort of nourishment
suitable to their estate; their discretion and patience in correcting
and teaching the Indians; their resignation in all kinds of adversity:
everything, in short, contributes to make the inhabitants of that land
regard them as supernatural beings, and in the light of this conception
the fathers exercise over the Indians a moral force more powerful than
even that of the government. The Indians live in entire moral
separation from the Spaniards; they have their own laws of tradition,
their own opinions and customs, entirely unknown to any one who is
ignorant of their language or has not continual intercourse with them.
The European religious are the only persons in the confidence of the
government who by favor of these circumstances, and with a practical
and intimate knowledge of the nature and inclinations of the natives
there, can find a way into their hearts, incline their wills to what is
right, enlighten them, and keep them peaceful and submissive; and
without this larger armies would be of no avail.</p>
<p>[The religious are the only persons who understand the condition of
their respective villages, and the alcaldes-mayor are usually indolent
and inefficient, relying on native interpreters, and caring little for
aught save their own profit; they depend on the religious in all cases
of difficulty, and the higher authorities are jealous of this
superiority of the religious. The government ought to maintain as many
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>religious as possible in the islands, and give
them as much political authority as is consistent with their ministry;
five hundred of them should be sent there, and the alcaldes-mayor
should be obliged to consult every month with their respective curas on
the best means of promoting the interests of the people, and the
central government can then act on reports of these conferences.]</p>

<p class="first">[The entrance of these persons causes trouble among
the people of the islands: the Indians are easily influenced by white
men, especially those who teach them to live in more freedom and
insubordination to authority; foreigners of this sort are almost always
of lax morals and dangerous political opinions, which are even more
dangerous to &ldquo;the Spaniards of the country, who, although more
enlightened than the Indians, are more susceptible to such
corruption.&rdquo; The foreigner thus residing in the islands,
&ldquo;usually from the dregs of other nations,&rdquo; makes light of
all the institutions there, and tries to set the people against the
mother country; and three times recently has occurred] the scandal,
unheard-of in that colony, of foreigners who, abusing the innocence of
the country, have, being already married in their own country, again
married Philippine Spanish girls, leaving them abandoned and
dishonored. Others, who feigned to be learned physicians and
agriculturists, have deceived and defrauded proprietors in the islands.
Others have clandestinely introduced impious, revolutionary, and
obscene books printed in the Spanish language, but pirated in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>France, with which they have caused atrocious
injury in the morals of families there. In fine, the settlement of
foreigners in the islands would not be expedient, even for the sake of
the advantages which their industry and arts would produce there; for
works carried on always with foreign capital, on the account of
foreigners, and by the agency of foreigners, would leave to the country
very little benefit as compared to that from labor employed there by
Spanish capital, and on the account and for the benefit of Spaniards.
If we desire to preserve intact in Filipinas the religious ideas and
the pure morals of our ancestors, and due submission to the government
of his Majesty, it is necessary to keep the people away from every
point of contact with foreigners. In China, Japan, and other nations,
the revolutionary spirit has not been able to penetrate, because the
laws of those kingdoms keep the gates closed to all strangers. In a
colony still in its infancy in customs and enlightenment&mdash;which,
like a school of education, needs to have for models men of sound
morals&mdash;it has been very absurd to allow to remain and become
citizens therein men who have served a term of exile, and
<i>polisones</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e3565src" href="#xd27e3565"
name="xd27e3565src">5</a> or vagabonds, sometimes followed by officers
of justice from the Peninsula; and that the Indian people should see
(as so many times I have seen) that this sort of men succeeded in
obtaining positions as corporals, revenue officials, and even militia
captains, solely from the circumstance of their being white men. It is
necessary always to remove from the colonies this sort of people, who
on account of their principles and their inclinations must be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>enemies of order and of government, permitting
therein the settlement only of respectable Spanish artisans and
merchants, whose upright conduct may serve as an example to that
neophyte people, while at the same time they make fortunes for
themselves. But even this point needs careful study, and in regard to
it I will present the following reflections.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd27e3573">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Of the residence of European Spaniards in
Filipinas</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By a necessary and inevitable effect of certain
causes, physical and moral, which would take too long to explain here,
the Spanish race in the colonies&mdash;or the descendants of Europeans,
and mestizos of these, born and reared there&mdash;have from their
birth political sentiments which are entirely opposite to those of
their ancestors and other Europeans. They regard the Indian as an
entirely passive being, the European as a foreigner, and the land as
exclusively their own. The educational institutions which thus far have
been founded in the colonies, with the object of uniting their
inhabitants, by means of enlightening them, under the same principles
of religion, morals, and politics, have not been able to uproot those
ideas; on the other hand, recent events in the Americas have proved
that the men who had most education and acquaintance with the sciences
were the party leaders [<i lang="es">corifeos</i>] of revolution and
independence. It ought to be regarded as an incontestable truth that as
soon as the Spanish race in Filipinas reaches a greater number than
that of the Europeans, and with this increase acquires a certain degree
of moral force, a war for independence will be declared; and according
to this idea the educational institutions, when there is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>not
sincerity in the minds of the persons and in the laws that aim at
encouraging this class of population in the colonies, have a tendency
hostile to the preservation of the royal government in them. This class
of Spanish families is, for another reason, very unfortunate in
Filipinas, and may be regarded as condemned to perpetual <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e3584" title="Source: slothfulnes">slothfulness</span>
and misery. They cannot devote themselves to agriculture, because in
that burning climate only the Indian resists labor so hard; nor to
handicrafts, because the wages which the Indian and the Sangley mestizo
alike earn, which is sufficient to meet their simple needs, is
insufficient to pay for another sort of food and clothing for the
Spaniards. For these same reasons, they cannot occupy themselves in the
coasting trade; nor, finally, in the commerce of the islands on a large
scale, for lack of sufficient capital, since by inheritance is divided
among all the sons the wealth which their European parents left to
them; and the practice of law is there a career to which resort is very
unfortunate. All these causes, added to the lassitude which the climate
inspires, maintain that class of people in such a condition of idleness
and poverty, especially the women, that it has been necessary to
establish in the capital alone six seminaries and beaterios in which to
shelter and educate Spanish girls; and that in the ordinance regarding
the Acapulco galleon his Majesty should grant to the Spanish widows of
merchants the special favor of a pension or widow&rsquo;s usufruct on
the boletas of that vessel, their only means of making a living.</p>
<p>[Bernaldez declares that these European Spaniards, &ldquo;there
abandoned, as it were, to the mercy of charity, or to vices,&rdquo; are
not only useless but dangerous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211"
href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>to the country; that among
them revolutions are born; that it is for the best interests of
Espa&ntilde;a to retain her population at home, and, while furnishing
means for Spaniards to enrich themselves in the colonies or their
trade, to attract to the mother country all possible wealth and
capital, not allowing her children to remain abroad after acquiring
wealth; and, finally, &ldquo;to remove from the colonies all cause of
insurrection, than which there is none greater and more terrible than
the propagation [therein] of the Spanish race.&rdquo; Moreover, the
Europeans settled in the colonies &ldquo;have too much influence,
through their exclusive wealth and connections, for weakening
governmental action there; and care nothing for any political changes
except as they can find therein opportunity for speculations&rdquo; (on
which he instances the action of European Spaniards in Mexico in
Iturbide&rsquo;s short reign, and in other events of the revolution
there). &ldquo;The Filipinas Islands need, to maintain them in
tranquillity, nothing more than a stable system of administration,
civil and spiritual, by means of religious, and an army trained and
commanded by competent European leaders, officers, sergeants, and
corporals, with the necessary number of civil officials.&rdquo; The
creole inhabitants should be diminished as much as possible, all
Spaniards being required to return with their families to their own
country; and &ldquo;aid given to destitute widows and orphans of
Spaniards who die in Filipinas would be better employed in paying for
their removal to Europa.&rdquo; This matter should be considered in the
residencia of every governor. Convicts and exiles should no longer be
sent to the islands. No foreigner should be allowed to marry there
except on condition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>of leaving the country with his wife. No
European adventurer or idler should be allowed to remain in the islands
unless he proffer sufficient security for his good conduct and
occupation; he may then remain not longer than ten years; otherwise, he
should be at once sent back whence he came. Every ship should carry
back to Espa&ntilde;a as many Spaniards as it brought to the islands;
and European Spaniards should not be allowed to remain in Filipinas
more than ten years, after which they should be compelled to return
with their families to Espa&ntilde;a.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[It is highly desirable that public officials should
undergo strict residencia, and that regulations be made for these,
which are adapted to the special needs of Filipinas. This is especially
true of the alcaldes-mayor, who, as they have permission to trade, are
more tempted to evade or infringe the laws; and many persons are
appointed to that office who &ldquo;lack all the qualifications
necessary for obtaining any public office whatever.&rdquo;
Unfortunately, since the royal decree of August 24, 1799, no alcalde
has been or can be subject to residencia, and they consequently enjoy
absolute impunity in their transgressions; for that decree does not
allow a sufficient time for complaints to be made in a country like
Filipinas, where intercourse between the provinces and the capital is
so uncertain, interrupted, and difficult, on account of the
vicissitudes of weather and climate, the lack of roads and postal
facilities, and the great distance of many provinces from Manila.
&ldquo;This <span class="corr" id="xd27e3599" title=

boats of traders, which injured the natives in their traffic&mdash;and
defrauded the Indians with unjust exactions; but they have humiliated
the religious, stolen moneys from the king, outraged young girls,
burned houses, and, in short, have thrown the provinces into a
condition of effervescence and of conspiracy against the government

should be of good morals, old enough to have stability of character,
sufficiently competent and experienced to understand their duties, and
such as will set a good example to the natives.] The imprudence of one
man alone has often been sufficient to incite a sedition in the minds
of various parties or castes in those islands; and in any case it is
very dangerous to entrust positions of command to persons who are not
endowed with well-proved ability and discretion. I cannot attribute the
laxity which in recent times is evident in all branches of the
administration and government of those islands to any other cause than
the injudicious selection of many of their employees. The military
corps, whose former captains and subalterns had been mainly sergeants
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=

order and discipline until, in the year &rsquo;23, those officers were
added to them who accompanied General Martinez&mdash;of some of whom,
according to the documents which were executed for my court, their
appointment to the Indias, with their scandalous conduct, looks like a
proof that in Espa&ntilde;a there was neither religion, morality, nor
subordination. [Bernaldez urges that certain qualifications be required
for office in Filipinas; the governors should be members of learned
bodies, and excel in discretion and ability, and in the art of
governing, and of promoting the welfare of a country, rather than in
the military art. The intendants should be &ldquo;enlightened
economists, capable of creating and promoting the great wealth of which
that virgin country is capable.&rdquo; The officials of the Audiencia
should be at least thirty-five years old, with ten years of service,
and experienced in legal practice; and other employees should be
trustworthy, experienced, and not mere youths. &ldquo;The Filipinas

<p class="first">[Exact and circumstantial information is of course,
necessary for the guidance of the home government in all measures
relating to the resources, needs, development, and administration of
the islands, and annual reports on all these matters are demanded from
governors and intendants by the laws of the Indias. Essential as this
requirement is, it has always been neglected.] What those officials
sometimes write, when questioned about these matters, are but
generalities; their reports and information are reduced to how much has
been produced and how much spent, in the r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the
royal exchequer accounts. Thus it is not known with what necessity and
justice certain extraordinary expenses have been incurred, what number
of employees the king has in that colony, what causes have occasioned
the increase or decrease in the product of the revenues, and, finally,
how the means and resources of the people who contribute to the royal
income can be augmented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=
"#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>so that the latter can likewise be
increased, all which the government ought to know. [It is true that the
governors are laden with multifarious routine duties, which often
prevent them from attending to these important matters, and from
examining conditions personally, for which they have to depend upon the
reports of their subordinates; and these are apt to be actuated by
self-interest and they do not like reforms, so their statements are not
very reliable. The reports made by the municipalities, commercial
consulate, and other bodies are of the same sort, as being always from
the standpoint of their corporation; and neither authorities nor
corporations have the same stimulus to thoroughness, accuracy, and
energy as has the private person who undertakes an enterprise. It is
through the latter class that great projects and advances are made, but
such persons hesitate to present plans for these to the authorities
there, because the authorities do not examine them personally,
&ldquo;but by means of a contentious, voluminous, and annoying <i lang=
"es">expediente</i>,&rdquo; and likewise have no authority to adopt
these plans until they are referred to Madrid&mdash;where, too, they
are not encouraged to bring such projects before the royal government,
and these, moreover, would have to be sent to Manila first (apparently
to contend there with the aforesaid <i lang="es">expediente</i>).
Bernaldez continues:] In order, then, to awaken this interest of
enterprising private persons in the agriculture, manufactures, and
commerce of Filipinas, it is necessary to have there a body expressly
devoted to this object, and authorized to adopt provisionally any plan
for improvement and progress which may be proposed to it and examined
by it with the aid of its special knowledge of the country; and this
body <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=

exchequer of the islands&#8202;&hellip;. This council, as such, has
very little occupation; its ministers, like all who are employed in
Filipinas, attend to their official duties only in the forenoons,
remaining free during all the afternoons and evenings for employment in
a service of so great importance as this.</p>
<p>I am, then, of opinion that his Majesty should deign to establish
the following: That the superior council of the royal exchequer in
Filipinas constitute a similar council for the improvement and
prosperity of the country, with the object of stimulating in every way
the Indians to work, and capitalists to undertake enterprises. That its
members hold weekly meetings for this purpose, at such hours as the
president shall designate. That it also call in the proprietors of
lands, agriculturists, manufacturers, and merchants of the country,
listen to their views, and encourage them to propose reforms and plans
for promoting the useful arts. That it be authorized to decide upon the
execution of projects, provisionally, until the approbation of his
Majesty is secured, in all matters which do not occasion loss to the
country or injure the interests of the treasury. That it can draw upon
the treasury of the community for a moderate amount of necessary
expenses for the encouragement and reward of enterprises, for anything
which can bring a positive and general benefit to the Indians and the
government.</p>

in the recent governments of Filipinas. The governor-presidents have
entirely separated themselves from their audiencias, and have governed
alone&mdash;sometimes in military fashion, not heeding the opinions and
customs of the country, but depending on force of arms; and sometimes
only by the advice of the lawyer who assists the governor, who has the
title of government counselor [<i lang="es">asesor</i>], and who,
although he ought to limit himself to giving opinion on points and
cases regarding statutes, is counselor in all the arduous matters of
administration. From this it has resulted that the fate of the colonies
may be left in the hands of this class of counselors, and that their
subordinates have had so much power and importance. [Moreover, this
course leads to dissensions and hostilities between the governor and
the Audiencia, which is a bad example to furnish to the people and
lowers their respect for the authorities.] It must be borne in mind
that the Indians of Filipinas are not so sunken in ignorance that they
do not of themselves, and likewise through their attorneys and
confessors, recognize that they have a sovereign who rules them, and
who to this end has given them laws; consequently, all lack of concord

they made agreements, placed limits to the villages, furnished a sort
of municipal ordinance, and protected the natives against the
oppressions of the alcaldes-mayor. Notwithstanding my high opinion of
that tribunal, I regard as very proper the provisions of law xxxiv,
t&iacute;tulo ii, book ii of the laws of the Indias in regard to the
removal and promotion of its ministers, basing my opinion on the same
arguments as did the law&mdash;that is, that it is very desirable not
only to reward them, but to uproot them from the friendships which they
contract in places where they remain a long time. These friendships,
whose influence is always detrimental to the equitable administration
of justice, are in Manila an almost necessary result of the small
Spanish population, of the lack of all public amusement or diversion,
and of the fact that with the enervating effect of the climate the
rectitude and vigor of European morals is lost after some years of
residence in the country. [The Audiencia has been unable to attend to
the administration of justice in the islands as it has desired, for it
has always been hindered by the many obstacles which arise from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>storms, the lack of roads and mail service, the
attraction of all the lawyers in the islands to the capital, the
ignorance of the gobernadorcillo and the alcalde of each other&rsquo;s
language and of judicial procedures, the dilatory mode of carrying on
these between the provinces and Manila, etc. &ldquo;Thus it is very
common that these lawsuits, besides being always full of defects, last
three, four, or six years; and that in that long period either the
delinquents take to flight, or the documents are lost.&rdquo; Even in
the Audiencia itself there are many obstacles to its action. Its
subordinate officials are Indian or mestizo lawyers, who often are
neither competent nor qualified for their positions;] and that which
most contributes to retard the despatch of business, and to maintain
the offices of the court without any organization, is the unfitness of
those who occupy the class or purchasable and renunciable offices. The
court clerk, the special commissioners, and the attorneys know nothing
else than how to obtain the greatest possible advantage from the
purchase of their offices. Without any instruction in the obligations
of those positions, because they cannot acquire it in that country, and
incapable of carrying out even what the ministers themselves have the
patience to teach them, those men are, notwithstanding, the only ones
whom the ministers can choose for those offices, because they are
likewise the only ones who can outbid others in the sale of them. These
positions are also of little advantage, because in the immense
extension of the military jurisdiction, among the wealthy persons of
Filipinas, the tribunal of the War Department has drawn to itself all
the civil causes of importance in the islands; and the Audiencia has
been reduced to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222"
name="pb222">222</a>]</span>criminal causes, and the minor
controversies over land among the Indians, for which reason it is
impossible to have educated Europeans who will purchase those posts and
serve in them. The consequence of this is that the offices of the
Audiencia are in the utmost disorder; that they do not contain even the
books of entry which the laws provide for, or registers, citations, or
reports of cases; that in order to record a decree or an official
report it is necessary for a minister to take upon himself the task of
doing that; and, finally, that the administration of justice must
necessarily be slow. [Bernaldez therefore recommends that the ministers
of the Audiencia be promoted at least every ten years to other
appointments; that the minor offices be no longer purchasable or
renunciable, but filled directly by royal appointment, and given to
suitable persons, with good salaries (which are specified); and that
the government of the islands provide some expedient for raising money
to pay the salary of an attorney-general in each province.]</p>

<p class="first">[The office of alcalde-mayor and provincial governor
involves the civil government and defense of the province, the
administration of justice, and the collection of the taxes; but those
who are appointed to it are usually only traders, in reality, and care
more for the profits yielded by the trade that is permitted to them
than for the obligations of their office. They are paid twenty-five
hard dollars a month for salary, &ldquo;and they pay to the treasury
the same sum for the <i lang="es">indulto</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, privilege],

pursuit they devote all their time and energies during the term of
their office.] A system of alcaldeships so anomalous and irregular
nevertheless produced at the outset some benefits to the islands,
because, by reason of the great lack of capitalists there, many
products of the agriculture and industries of the provinces would have
received no encouragement if the alcalde had not speculated in them for
the sake of his own trade. It is also necessary to note that there are
provinces with which, on account of their remoteness and the little
advantage which they have for the coasting trade, there was hardly any
other means of communication than the barks of the alcalde. But now,
when the coasting trade has become so general, it is a necessity to
abolish, in most of the provinces of the islands, that absurd system of
trading alcaldes; and to appoint in their places corregidors, lawyers
educated in Espa&ntilde;a, with only a salary, and the charge of making
collections for the royal revenue, with the right to the offices in the
Audiencia there. This increase in expenditure should be covered by the
duties which ought to be imposed on the coasting trade, which by this
means remains free from all impediment. [Bernaldez urges that the
provincial magistrates be carefully selected, for their knowledge,
experience, discretion, and executive ability; and that they be men who
will devote themselves to the proper administration of justice, the
study of those regions hitherto unknown, plans of reform, and the
encouragement of industry and commerce among the people&mdash;not
forgetting to preserve friendly relations with the parish priests. He
recommends that seventeen of the provinces in the islands of Luzon,
Panay, and Ceb&uacute; be divided <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"

into those of the first class, and nine into those of the second, with

for six years; and that corregidors of the first class be proposed by

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the taxes</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[At present, the tribute paid by the Indians should
not be increased because so many of them would be distressed by any
heavier tax; but this might be done later, when the class of large
proprietors may have increased in numbers. The payment of this tax in
kind is a source of loss, not only in the quantity and quality of the
products paid in, but in the damage caused by transportation and
storage; and in selling the products thus received by the government
there is loss, because its agents are poor managers of such business,
not having the shrewdness or the knowledge of the markets which enable
private merchants to make their profits. The commutation of the payment
from money to kind was only partly due to the influence of the
alcaldes, who preferred it for the benefit of their own trading;] the
cause which has rendered that commutation almost necessary and which
operates directly to the prejudice of the Indian, is the lack of a
colonial money peculiar to the Filipinas Islands, like that which the
other possessions in Asia have (of the necessity of which I will speak
in another chapter), in order to revive internal commerce and promote
and facilitate the payment of taxes.</p>
<p>The indirect taxes by means of government monopolies in Filipinas
are, in my opinion, those most suitable to the native disposition of
inhabitants who, furnished most abundantly by the soil with all the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>income necessary for their support, convert the
superfluous enjoyments of life into objects of prime necessity. It
should be a firm principle of good government to protect and rectify
the administration of these indirect taxes, especially those on tobacco
and wine&mdash;not only because these will be sufficient to cover
abundantly all the expenses of army and navy, but because in case of a
war and the absolute cessation of trade the government will have this
firm support for its existence; and therefore no hearing should be
given to the suggestions and proposals of those persons who are
craftily working to free the islands from those monopolies. But so long
as these taxes are not made general through all the provinces of the
archipelago, so that the fire of the contraband trade (which always
finds lodgment in the exempt provinces) may be extinguished, and until
certain reforms are adopted in their administration and protection, the
produce [of these taxes] in favor of the royal exchequer must be very
disproportionate to the amounts consumed by that large population.</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the revenue from tobacco</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The revenue which supports the Filipinas Islands,
which cannot be replaced by any other, and which if it were properly
established and administered would yield incalculable advantages, is
that from tobacco. Three millions of inhabitants, all without exception
of sex or age consumers of that article&mdash;and for each one of them,
on the average, and at a very low estimate, can be set down a
consumption of four pesos [worth] a year&mdash;would produce an
addition to the revenue of twelve million pesos, which they would
obtain from the land and from their industries, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>order to give at the same time a great impulse
to commerce. This is not a paradox, for the use of tobacco is of so
prime necessity for the Indians that the same calculation can be made
for that object that would be made for the use of bread in
Espa&ntilde;a. [Bernaldez considers the injurious effects of enforcing
this monopoly in only a part of the islands&mdash;&ldquo;although more
than half the population is today subject to the monopoly, its income
is only one-tenth of what, at a reasonable estimate, it ought to
be&rdquo;&mdash;and those of its careless and negligent administration.
He makes the following suggestions:] That the collection of the
tributes from the Indians of Filipinas be made compulsory in money, as
soon as the colonial money can be placed in circulation in their
provinces. That the monopoly of tobacco in Filipinas be extended to all
the [now] exempt provinces, without exception; and the government there
will succeed much better in establishing it therein by sagacity than by
authority or force. That the examination and appraisal of the leaf
tobacco which the monopoly purchases from the growers be made before a
board which the government there shall appoint annually, composed of
officials from the capital who are most trustworthy and intelligent in
that branch of administration, such tobacco as proves to be unfit for
use being burned in their presence. That all the tobacco which can be
collected in Filipinas be conveyed to Espa&ntilde;a, by means of
contracts with private persons for the freighting of ships; and with it
the amount which can be remitted from the [different] branches of the
royal exchequer, and the annual surplus of their funds. <span class=

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the revenue from wine</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The product of the revenue from wine cannot in
Filipinas be considered so important as that from tobacco, because the
Indians are very moderate in their drinking. The wines made from the
cocoanut and nipa (the only ones subject to the monopoly) are wholesome
for the Indians; and as the monopoly has regulated the supply for each
village, greatly improving the process of making the liquor and
diminishing its strength, the Indians prefer the monopoly to the free
privilege of this article. The failure of this revenue to increase
depends on two causes: first, that the monopoly is not extended, as it
ought to be, to all the provinces of the islands, not only thus to
place all the natives on the same footing, and so suppress the
contraband trade, but to prevent by this method the manufacture by the
Indians of other beverages which are more injurious to their health,
and which, without giving them pleasure, intoxicate them as has been
the case with the brandy and rum from sugar-cane juice or molasses;
second, the great amount of the two last-named liquors which is
clandestinely furnished to the public, as a result of the permission,
very negligently guarded, which was given to manufacture them freely to
export abroad, or to sell them under a certain tax in order that they
should not injure the consumption of the article placed under monopoly
control. [Bernaldez admits that the manufacture of the above-mentioned
brandy and rum ought to be allowed, &ldquo;because otherwise the
country would lose the enormous quantity of molasses which results from
the sugar-making, which has a considerable value, but cannot be
employed for other uses;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228"
href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>but the government ought to
maintain the value of the monopolized beverages, and at the same time
facilitate the exportation of rum and brandy.<a class="noteref" id=

recommends, besides the extension of the wine monopoly:] That, as a
consequence, every other kind of beverage made in the country be
prohibited in the islands for the common use of the Indians. That the
manufacture of brandy and rum from sugar-cane be allowed only for the
export trade. That each manufacturer be likewise allowed to have a
retail warehouse, under the imposts which they now pay. That the
manufacturers be compelled to establish their factories in the
immediate vicinity of Manila, where they can and must be watched, at
their own expense, by the revenue clerks. That all the brandy and rum
which is made from sugar be immediately deposited in warehouses, the
keys of which the custom-house shall take charge of, the government
levying on it moderate duties for deposit as well as for
export.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3726src" href="#xd27e3726" name=

<p class="first">[The Chinese were at first allowed in Filipinas only
to cultivate the soil and work in handicrafts; but they have drawn into
their possession the control of trade and commerce, &ldquo;winning the
good-will of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=

inhabitants of Manila with a thousand intrigues unknown in the country.
They have done in Filipinas what the Europeans ought to have done, that
is, to acquire wealth and send it, or themselves go with it, to their
own country to establish commercial houses;&rdquo; and thus they have
added a marvelous amount to the wealth of China. Their method of doing
business is explained&mdash;practically the same as is done in the
United States at the present time; united capital and effort, division
of the gains accordingly, quick sales and small profits, etc. They have
obtained the exclusive retail trade in Manila, and a great part of the
wholesale trade, &ldquo;and thereby have aroused the hostility of
corporations and private persons, notwithstanding that they are a class
of peaceable and industrious people in the country.&rdquo; Bernaldez
thinks that their tax of six pesos a year is much too small,
considering the advantages which they enjoy and the large fortunes
which they acquire in the islands; in Batavia the Chinese pay the
government as much as thirty pesos a month for merely the permission to
trade. The tax on them at Manila is farmed out to a Chinaman, and does
not yield as much as it should. The following recommendations are
made:] That measures be immediately taken to correct and render
accurate the registration of the Chinese settled in Filipinas. That the
individuals of that nation be divided into three classes: first,
wholesale merchants, understanding by that term all those who embark
for China and receive thence goods on commission or for their own
account; second, retail merchants, or shopkeepers; third, artisans of
every class. That these be distributed by groups under head-men
[<i lang="es">por cabecerias</i>], <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>which shall not exceed sixty
individuals to each one. That every Chinaman, as soon as he is
registered, shall be joined to one of these groups, the head-man
becoming responsible for him. That these Chinese heads of barangay must
give security for the tribute from those under them, and collect the
tax and deliver it to the alcalde-mayor of their respective province,
being responsible in every case for the residence and occupation of
their tribute-payers; and for this commission collecting the three per
cent. That in future the tax on the Chinese already settled and those
who shall settle in Filipinas shall be as follows: the wholesale
merchant, ten pesos fuertes a month; the retail merchant, four pesos
ditto; the artisan of every class, two pesos ditto. That every Chinaman
settled there shall be free to return to his own country, provided he
is not married, the limit of six months being allowed for this. That
the Chinaman, of whatever class, who shall not pay his respective tax
within one year shall be sent and delivered up to one of the
ranch-owners for compulsory labor [<i lang="es">por repartimiento</i>],
in order that there he may work at the day-wages agreed upon, which
must not fall below two reals a day and food-rations of rice; and that
the ranchman shall with these wages pay the tax [due], at the rate of
two pesos a month.</p>
<p>[Among the advantages derived from this arrangement will be that of
sending out of the islands the many poor and useless Chinese who have
been gradually multiplying there, and have been infecting the natives
with their vices. It will even benefit the Chinese themselves,
&ldquo;who with two reals a day, which make 7&frac12; dollars a month
clear&rdquo; (thus showing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the custom-house duties</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The royal decree of August 25, 1818, by which it was
decided that the exaction of import and export duties should be made in
the Manila custom-house from the owners of the vessels, without
considering the ownership of their lading, and that if the vessel were
Spanish it should pay three per cent, and if foreign six per cent, has
been a special favor or privilege granted to half a dozen Spanish
ship-owners (for those who conduct the commerce with China and Bengala
cannot be more than that number), with serious loss to the exchequer.
This is, of course, annually deprived of the considerable income of the
three per cent rebate on all foreign goods imported into Manila, which
is a direct benefit to the foreigners who own nearly all the commerce
in those goods. The manufacturers of Filipinas, especially those of
cotton fabrics&mdash;which are able to compete with, and even exceed in
cheapness, those of China, since the cotton of which these are made is
of their own raising&mdash;are being ruined, because that rebate of
duties brings the prices of the Chinese goods so near to those of their
infant industry that the former ought always to be preferred; and,
finally, the above arrangement has also given opportunity for various
frauds proceeding from the pretended sale of foreign vessels to
Spaniards, solely for the purpose of availing themselves of the rebate
of duties on their cargoes, and to the possession (under assumed names)
by Chinese settled in Manila of Spanish vessels.</p>
<p>[Bernaldez states the considerations which should <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>regulate these duties, and the following
recommendations for the payment of duties on various classes of
merchandise, this amount to cover in each case the entire exaction: On
national goods in transit, carried to Manila&mdash;on a Spanish vessel,
three per cent; on a foreign ship, six per cent. The same goods for
consumption in the country shall pay nine and ten per cent
respectively. On foreign goods from India and China, for domestic
consumption, ten and fifteen per cent respectively; from this class
should be excepted the wines, brandies, pig iron, small articles of
cast iron, dry beans, and foreign paper, which should pay twenty and
twenty-five per cent respectively. Goods, whether national or foreign,
not declared as in transit at leaving Manila shall pay two and four per
cent respectively; but those registered on a Spanish ship from India,
China, and all Asia for Espa&ntilde;a, ten per cent. Coined silver and
gold, and silver bullion, shall pay no entrance duty at Manila, but on
leaving that port shall pay three and six per cent respectively; and
foreign gold in bullion shall pay eight per cent at entering Manila
(whether on Spanish or foreign vessels). National products, and those
of the industries of Filipinas, shall pay when exported eight per cent
on a foreign vessel, but nothing on a Spanish ship. The duty of the
merchant&rsquo;s peso [<i lang="es">peso marchante</i>] which the
municipality of Manila collects should be abolished as obstructive to
commerce; for the legal origin of this imposition is unknown, and it is
very unsuitable for a municipality which is rich through its rents,
revenues, and imposts. Bernaldez believes that this tariff would
promote agriculture, industry, and navigation, and benefit the royal
treasury. More coin would be brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>into the islands, the
plan of exempting it from duties having been adopted for that purpose
by all the other governments of Asia. The burden of these duties will
fall mainly on the rich class, and not on the Indians. The
&ldquo;infant industries&rdquo; [<i lang="es">fabricas nacientes</i>]
will be protected, and the Spanish merchant marine will be given the
advantage over the foreigners.]</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Of the inter-island trade</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The inter-island trade of the Filipinas Islands is at
present quite active, as is shown by the latest reports received. Its
importance is well worth consideration, since the commodities which are
traded in this way constitute the greater part of the cargoes of the
export commerce. Tortoise-shell, gold, birds&rsquo;-nests, balate, wax,
cacao, and other products form cargoes of great value which come from
the provinces. The exclusive proprietors of this commerce are the
alcaldes-mayor of the provinces, and the rich mestizos and Chinese, who
in this traffic have made exorbitant profits, for it is these alone who
exclusively avail themselves of the rise in prices which is produced in
Manila by the arrival there of foreign vessels together. This causes
those posts of alcalde there to be very eagerly sought, since in only
three years of holding them they allow [the making of] a fortune; and
also that the class of mestizos and Chinese is the only one that is
sure of becoming rich in Filipinas&#8202;&hellip;. The result is, that
with the exception of the great fortunes which in other times were made
in the privileged commerce of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, it is this [coasting
trade] from which have proceeded the fortunes of Manila. [This branch
of trade is exempt from all duties, a privilege which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>does
not benefit either the agriculture or the other industries of the
Indians, since they always sell at the same price, and have no share in
the profits of the trade. Nor is this commerce promoted by the freedom
from duties, for it will always continue and always yield great profits
to those who carry it on&mdash;who can well afford to pay a moderate
tax on their lucrative trade, especially as it is partly for their
benefit that the government incurs so great expense for curbing the
piracies of the Moros. It is recommended:] That all commodities,
whether natural products or those of industry, which arrive at the port
of Manila by sea from the provinces shall pay one per cent on the
prices current in that city; and from this tax shall be exempted only
rice (whether in the hull or cleaned), cocoanut oil, and fresh fruits,
as being articles of prime necessity for the Indians. That no duty
shall be collected for those same products when they are transported by
land, or by the rivers and bayous of the island of Luzon. And that,
from the time when this law shall go into effect, the power which the
municipality of Manila has to tax the value of the provisions which
come from the provinces shall be suppressed. The exemption from duties
will tend, in regard to the provinces of Luzon, to encourage in that
island pre&euml;minently, as is desirable, agriculture and industry,
and at the same time will save to the custom-house the new expenses
which it would [otherwise] have to incur for establishing posts and men
to guard against smuggling.</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Of money</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Spanish peso is the universal money in the
commerce among all the nations of Asia; and, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>therefore the exterior commerce is constantly
drawing it into circulation, the governments of all the colonies in
that part of the world have found themselves obliged to create a
colonial money, which on account of its provisional value cannot be
taken out of the country, and, being directed into the internal
commerce of the province, feeds and multiplies exchanges. In Filipinas
there was no need of adopting that measure while its commerce with
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a lasted, because then those islands were receiving
annually a million of Mexican pesos, and the situado of two hundred and
fifty thousand; and, besides this, the business that was carried on
during that period in the natural and industrial products of the
country was almost insignificant. And if in Filipinas at this present
time enough money circulates to support the outside traffic, that
results from the fact that the profits which the colony has gained from
the commerce with all the nations of Europa (the balance of which is in
favor of Filipinas) are greater than the losses of money which it
experiences in its commerce with India and China. [This is of course a
very precarious situation; for the contingencies of war, diversion of
commerce from the islands, or poor crops may at any time compel
Filipinas to send out all its money to India or China for the supply of
its needed commodities; and this would ruin even the internal commerce,
&ldquo;on account of the serious difficulties which the establishment
of a system of public credit there presents.&rdquo;] Besides that,
considering now the matter of giving a strong impulse to the
agriculture and industry of those islands, there would be needed for
the former project many millions of pesos in constant circulation in
the provinces, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>and there must be a great reversion of the
capital employed in commerce to the interior of the islands; and this
cannot be practiced in a country in which hardly enough money
circulates to support the government and the demands from without, and
which had undertaken to promote its interests by commerce before
placing its agriculture and industry on a sound basis. In almost all
the provinces of the islands very little money circulates, and in some
of them there is not even what is necessary in order that the natives
can pay the government taxes; and from this has proceeded the necessity
of commuting the tribute from money to kind. The Spanish pesos go from
and return to the provinces rapidly; and it can be said that the
produce of the taxes which has to be sent annually to the capital, and
the importations of the alcaldes and the mestizos, are equal. Most of
the Indians trade among themselves by means of simple barter, and the
mestizos make them pay dearly with their products for the money that
they need for clothing themselves and paying their taxes.</p>
<p>There is, then, nothing to hope for&mdash;either advance in
agriculture and the useful arts, or the great extension and progress of
which the consumption of monopolized articles is
susceptible&mdash;without the creation of a colonial money which will
remain within the colony to which it belongs, which will liberate it
from the precarious dependence on foreign commerce, which will afford
to the Indian the just profits from his labor, which by remaining with
him in the provinces will encourage him to obtain possession of it as
an easy means of providing him with the necessities of life at the time
[when he needs them,] and which likewise may be an allurement to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>his children&mdash;which up to a certain point
it is of great importance to encourage in the Indians, as a powerful
incentive to make them labor. [Lastly, this colonial money would check
the exportation of silver coin by the Chinese,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3814src" href="#xd27e3814" name="xd27e3814src">10</a> who would
then prefer to export from Filipinas its nature products in return for
their commodities. In China all the Spanish pesos are, in order to keep
them within the empire, disfigured with so many marks that they cannot
be used in foreign commerce.] We have no knowledge thus far of there
being silver mines in Filipinas; but it is a positive fact that gold
abounds there, of so low grade and so mingled with silver that it has
little more value than that metal. This circumstance, aided by the
introduction of some silver bars from America, carried thither by
foreigners, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>the recoinage of the half-dollars, and of the
silver two-real, one-real, and half-real pieces which circulate in the
islands, and the use of the great amount of old silver in household
articles&mdash;which is there sold at very low prices, on account of
being alloyed and manufactured in China&mdash;would supply the
government with easy means for the creation of a colonial currency
without need for expense, or for forestalling [the income from] any
fund, only by accepting from the persons interested their respective
materials in gold or silver, under assay, and returning to them the
value of the metal in the coined money which it would yield, after
deducting the necessary expenses. Likewise the government could accept,
in payment of all taxes, the gold which is obtained from the placers,
at the same prices at which the Chinese carry it away, and after it was
assayed at its mint&mdash;where the learned professors who for this
purpose would be sent from Europe would dictate the necessary measures
for carrying into effect an undertaking which is the basis for all
progress in the islands. I am therefore of opinion that his Majesty
should deign to issue the following orders: That a colonial currency be
immediately created for internal circulation in the Filipinas Islands.
That for this purpose a mint be established there. That the standard
for this money be the same as those of the moneys of the same kind
which have been adopted in the other colonies of Asia. That the
subdivisions of its value be made according to the needs of internal
trade. That all the gold and silver, in various forms, which private
persons offer for coinage be accepted at the mint, returning it to them
in the standard coin which it yields after the expenses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>are
deducted. That the government there be authorized to accept in payment
of taxes the gold from the mines of Filipinas, after it is assayed.
That regulations be drawn up by competent persons, in which precautions
are taken against any fraud in this matter.</p>

<p class="first">[The obras p&iacute;as merit full attention from the
government,] on account of the advantages which the agriculture and
industry of the islands may gain from them. If the limited and
privileged dealings of Manila with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a had not been
reduced to a merely passive commerce of transfer or transportation,
those foundations would, at the same time while they have become
wealthy, have given real opulence to that commerce. Of the enormous
profit of two hundred and three hundred per cent which the transactions
of the galleon yielded at Acapulco, the greater part was for the
foreign dealers of India and China, whose wares supplied almost all the
lading of the galleons, and for the obras p&iacute;as; a greatly
reduced profit remained for the Manila merchants, which could be shown
by a calculation which might be made of the many millions imported from
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a by the galleons, and of the comparatively small
value, in money or assistance, which has remained [therefrom] in the
islands. [The returns from these funds are now greatly diminished,
since the cessation of the Acapulco trade, for on that depended the
commerce with India and China, which also has practically ended, save
for the commodities from those countries which are consumed in
Filipinas. This could not have been foreseen by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=

moreover, are impeded by various restrictions and conditions; and the
government should interpose its authority not only to secure the
fulfilment of the founders&rsquo; wishes, but to commute the investment
of the funds in such a way that they may be used to promote the
agriculture and industry of the country. These funds ought also to be
preserved as a most useful resource in case of war or revolution, when
the usual revenues of the government would cease. Bernaldez therefore
recommends:] That the government of Manila furnish special protection
to the charitable foundations of the islands, and keep close watch over
their honest administration. That it stimulate the managers to obtain
immediately from the competent authority the commutation of the
allotments of these funds so as to benefit the agriculture and
manufactures of the country, giving reports of what shall be effected
in a matter so important for the welfare of the islands. That the funds
in the communal treasuries of the Indians and the Chinese, those of the
secular revenues,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3834src" href="#xd27e3834"

private foundations and regulations, and which hitherto have followed
in their investments the rules of the obras p&iacute;as, shall be by
preference set aside for rewards bestowed for enterprises in
agriculture, industry, and inter-island trade. Thus will be remedied
the injury arising from the failure of those great funds to be in
circulation; and the abuse of employing them in favor of foreigners and
their commerce, under assumed names, will be corrected. <span class=

cost by means of private contracts awarded to the lowest bidder, which
is proved by the history of all the enterprises which have been
undertaken by the government in those islands, whether in agriculture,
mining, or metal-working; &ldquo;for, however great the
disinterestedness and economy which can be ascribed to the officials
who conduct the enterprise, in this direction nothing can take the
place of the contractor&rsquo;s activity and vigilance.&rdquo; In the
cutting and gathering of timber there is abundant cheating and graft,
as that work is directed by Indian overseers, or by mestizos and
Chinese; the latter have abandoned the system of day wages
(&ldquo;which the natural slothfulness of the Indian renders very
costly&rdquo;), and instead pay the natives so much for a certain
amount of work (which they call <i>paqueao</i>). &ldquo;In this way the
Indians, who always are cheated in these calculations, have to redouble
their efforts to gain the amount bargained for, thus allowing to the
mestizo the benefit of at least one-third of the usual daily

necessary supplies and materials be secured by contracts, bid for in

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Of the agriculture of the Filipinas Islands, in
general, and of their principal productions</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Filipinas Islands, on account of the fertility of
their land, their abundant rains, and the great number of animals for
labor, constitute an agricultural colony; and to the readiness with
which the country supplies the principal articles for human support has
been due the rapid increase of its population. And although the
Indians, as a general thing, only devote themselves to the cultivation
of what they actually need for subsistence, the annual production so
far exceeds the necessities of the people that very seldom has the
failure or scarcity of provisions been experienced. The abundance of
its arable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>lands and the excellence of its products have
also rendered this colony capable of a considerable commerce with the
other nations, at a much greater advantage over the other colonies,
inasmuch as the land is tilled by free labor, which costs only the
value of its food and clothing; and not by slaves, who, besides those
expenses, occasion that of the premium or interest on the money
invested in their purchase, which causes a difference of at least a
third more in the cost of the manual labor employed in agriculture.</p>
<p>The neglected condition in which agriculture is in Filipinas,
considered under this last aspect, and the backwardness in knowledge of
the manipulations required in the preparation of its raw products for
their consumption in trade, proceed from the following causes: (1) The
lack of a stable and regular system of commerce which can assure to the
inhabitants of the islands the annual exportation of the produce of an
extensive agriculture. The foreign vessels resort to the ports there,
some years in excessive number and others very infrequently; and this
irregularity always produces an effect opposed to the interests of the
colony. The extraordinary rise in prices&mdash;which during the last
three years has reached a value double that from which the ability to
sell at all times would enable the colony to gain a profit&mdash;and
the consequent lack of commodities for supplying all the vessels,
prevent them from returning in the following years; while the decline
of prices below what is fair, caused by the non-arrival of ships,
discourages large production in agriculture. The Indians are absolutely
without capital and storehouses which would enable them to hold back
their produce for another market. They are induced to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>cultivate the soil solely by their present
advantage; they always sell, but they suffer from the stern law of
trade which, although it flatters them in years of scarcity, equally
tyrannizes over them in years of abundance&mdash;for they are always
deceived regarding the actual prices of the general market, of which
they are ignorant; and one year only of unsuccessful sales, whether
from lack of foreign ships, or through the loss of their crops, will be
a warning to them for a long time. In short, the agriculture of
Filipinas at this time depends on the irregular and transient stimulus
which is furnished to it by the peripatetic capital of the mestizo, who
buys only in the years when he calculates that he must in view of the
condition of the crops and the market, make a profit; while the Indian
farmer always sows his seed heedless of results, and without the
guidance of that elementary principle in affairs of commerce that the
estimate of what he acquires ought to be based on a calculation of the
market for it. For the corrective of this evil, and assuming that, for
reasons that are rightful and conformable to sound policy (as I have
set forth), the residence of foreigners in the islands ought not to be
permitted, I find no other means than this, that the government
encourage, by judicious measures, the direct and unlimited commerce of
Espa&ntilde;a with that colony&mdash;of which I shall speak in another
chapter, [presenting] the rough sketch of a plan which ought to produce
the following effects: (a) The definite and reliable annual exportation
from those islands, not only of the great quantity of sugar, indigo,
coffee, and other native products which are needed in the ordinary
consumption of Espa&ntilde;a, but of that which Spanish commerce can
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>dispose of in the other nations and free ports
of Europa. (b) The establishment of Spanish trading posts [<i lang=
"es">factorias</i>] in the interior of the provinces of Filipinas,
which the Spanish mercantile interests will carry on for the sake of
acquiring the agricultural produce at first hand, freeing the Indians
from the oppressive rule of the mestizo trader, and forming contracts
with them, at prices agreed upon, for a certain number of years.</p>
<p>[The backward condition of agriculture proceeds] (2) from the lack
of great agricultural establishments. One of the causes for this is the
fact that the capital of the islands, which ought to be employed for
that object, has been diverted by the commerce of India, China, and
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, which offers greater and quicker profits. The
religious orders administer their estates as in mortmain, or by
ecclesiastical rules. The Indians cultivate, not from inclination but
through necessity, the little plots of ground on which they have fixed
their abodes. They lack the buildings and appliances necessary for the
preparation of the little sugar and indigo that they collect; and from
that results the wretched and unreliable quality of those articles
which so discredits them in the trade. They lack also the capital to
incur the expenses of a regular plantation, and these enterprises
require costly outlays at the start. But this cause of backwardness
would be remedied by the impulse which would be given to commerce by
the exportation of native products, which would attract to agriculture
the capital which it has hitherto lacked, and by the special protection
which the government can grant to large capitalists who may devote
themselves to agriculture. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href=
"#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>(3) From the ignorance of the Indians, not only of the various
methods of making plantations, but of the means of preparing the raw
materials for their employment in the trade&mdash;a cause which is so
universal and so mischievous that the agricultural products of
Filipinas, which ought to be, on account of their excellent character
and the extent of territory of the islands, commodities which should
supply all the markets of Europe and hold the first rank in quality,
are the most scarce in general commerce, and moreover lowest in price,
as I am going to prove by some instances. The sugar of Filipinas is
today the most important commodity for exportation which the commerce
there includes. The cultivation of the sugar-cane cannot be improved;
but the manufacture of the sugar is so defective that, in spite of the
superior quality of the cane, the sugar which is produced from it is
inferior to that which is called <i lang="es">terciado</i>
[<i>i.e.</i>, brown] at Habana. Although in the market of Cadiz the
white sugar from Habana is worth thirty-two to twenty-five silver
reals, and the brown sugar twenty-six to twenty-eight, the white sugar
of Manila is worth twenty-four to twenty-five<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3880src" href="#xd27e3880" name="xd27e3880src">12</a>&mdash;that
is, nine silver reals less than the former, and two or three reals less
than the latter on each arroba. Consequently, the temporary privilege
granted by his Majesty in exempting the products of Filipinas from
duties is the only support of the expeditions which have come [thence]
to the Peninsula; and it is unquestionable that when that privilege
ceases that commerce will likewise come to a complete stop. For
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>if from the twenty-four silver reals, the
highest price at which an arroba of the Manila sugar can be sold, be
deducted for duties eight reals and twenty-seven maraved&iacute;s, the
trader will receive a price of only nineteen silver reals, five
cuartos; subtracting from this the fourteen and one-half reals of the
prime cost at Manila (according to the latest information received),
and the only profit left to him would be four reals, three
maraved&iacute;s&mdash;with which it is absolutely impossible for him
to pay either the heavy freight charges on that commodity, or the
interest on money and the insurance premiums, on a voyage three times
as long as that from Habana. The low price [of sugar] in the market has
no other cause than the lack of skill at Manila for manufacturing the
sugar; this art is there found entirely in its infancy, and without any
other method than that which, since very ancient times, the Chinese
have taught them. [The sugar-makers have not proper machinery or
appliances, or the knowledge, for any of the stages of the process; and
their product is inferior, when it might be as good as that of
Habana&mdash;or even better, if the same skill and care were used in
making it as are used there. The above profit of nine reals on the
arroba, if equally divided among the grower, the manufacturer, and the
government (for duties which in that case should be imposed on the
sugar), would yield each of them $300,000 annually, on the estimated
production of 1,000,000 arrobas which would be practicable for
Filipinas&mdash;to say nothing of the increased benefits to the
laboring class&mdash;with improved methods of manufacture. To secure
this, the government must be energetic in promoting large
establishments there, and introducing machinery and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>skilled laborers. &ldquo;The funds in the
communal treasury of the Indians, which at the present time must reach
about $300,000, and whose object is the benefit of those same
Indians,&rdquo; might aid the government in meeting the expenses of
such measures; the skilled artisans could instruct the Indian farmers
in the new improved methods, and the industry would be almost perfected
in two years&rsquo; time, at very little expense. Bernaldez describes
in similar manner the deficiencies, possibilities, and needs of the
indigo, coffee, and cacao industries, and urges the government to
extend like care to these; what has been done thus far by the colonial
government has been quite ineffective, because it has been in the form
of proclamations and enactments which merely required small plantations
to be made by all the inhabitants, but these failed because they
disregarded the principles of political economy and made no provision
for the individual interest of the cultivator.] There are, then, two
means which ought to be adopted for the promotion of large plantations
in Filipinas, incentive and instruction; and for this it is necessary
to grant pecuniary rewards to the agriculturists, and furnish them with
teachers from the near-by islands of Java or even Bourbon, where not
only coffee but cacao is cultivated.</p>
<p>(4) And, finally, the cause which likewise exerts a powerful
influence in [causing] the neglected and backward condition of
agriculture is the slothfulness of the Indians and their absolute
indifference to acquiring and keeping property. [This sloth is caused
by the climate, the abundant supply of the necessities of life with
little labor, and the hospitality which prevails among the natives;]
and if it were not that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href=
"#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>in the capital and its adjacent
provinces there has now been introduced a certain degree of decency and
[even] luxury in some families of that class, it would be difficult to
find any one to render service or to practice the useful arts that are
necessary in villages. [With a people like this, it would be hazardous
to attempt to compel them to work; but &ldquo;even if they are
naturally slothful, they have their likes and dislikes; and a wise
government ought to avail itself of these two powerful resources to
urge them to work.&rdquo; The Indians dislike to pay direct taxes, and
hate the collector of these; also they are passionately fond of
cockfighting and spectacles of all sorts, and of office-holding; and if
these characteristics are considered in the policy of the government
much can be done to make them industrious. Bernaldez recommends: That a
system of direct, unlimited, and regular commerce be established
between Espa&ntilde;a and Filipinas, for the purpose of maintaining a
reliable and definite annual exportation of the latter&rsquo;s
products. That agricultural establishments be protected by the
government, being allowed (although at their own expense) the
assistance of a band of irregular soldiers. That machines, tools, and
other aids to agricultural production be admitted free of duties. That
skilled workmen be taken to the islands as instructors in the
manufacture of sugar and indigo, and cultivators of coffee, etc., with
their machinery and tools; their salaries for three years and their
transportation to Manila being paid from the communal funds of the
Indians. That large rewards be paid to the farmers who shall make large
plantations of coffee and other useful trees or establish the silk
industry. That the owners of these large plantations shall be allowed
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>keep on their lands each a cockpit for his
laborers, free of expense. That groups of Indians, Chinese, and
mestizos, limited to twenty families each, who shall maintain an indigo
or sugar plantation of a certain extent in good condition, shall be
relieved from paying the tribute so long as the plantation is kept up.
That every Indian who works for wages during five consecutive years, to
the satisfaction of his employer, shall be perpetually exempted from
tribute, the employer paying the laborer&rsquo;s tax for twenty years.
That the Indians and mestizos who cultivate large plantations on their
own account shall have the preference for the offices in their
respective villages. That the government of Filipinas take measures to
avoid frauds in connection with these proposed changes.]</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the anfion, or opium</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Bernaldez describes the efforts made by the English
East India Company to import opium into China, although against the
will of the Chinese government, and states that a certain amount is
smuggled into Manila to supply the Chinese settled in Filipinas; he
supposes that the prohibition of this trade in the islands arose from
the fear of the governors that the Indians would become habitual users
of this drug and thus be injured; but in his experience of seventeen
years in various judicial positions in Filipinas he has never seen a
scandalous case of opium inebriacy among the Chinese of Luzon, nor any
Indian brought into court for using the drug; and &ldquo;the Indians
without exception regard the use of opium with the utmost indifference
and contempt.&rdquo; He thinks that it should not be prohibited in
Filipinas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>since its use appears not to injure the Chinese
there, or to be necessary for the Indians; while the islands] ought not
to be deprived of a revenue that is exceedingly lucrative for
agriculture, commerce, and the treasury; of an article which in the
order of nature ought to be exclusively for the trade and benefit of
the islands; and a means by which the Manila commerce would draw great
wealth from China, turning in its favor, and with large sales, the
balance of trade with that empire, which is now and always has been
against Manila. A chest of opium, weighing one pico of Filipinas or 100
cates of China (each of 22 onzas), would probably cost the Manila
grower for all expenses at most 100 pesos; and its value in China is
usually 1,400 to 1,600 pesos. Add to this advantage that of the large
and secure market which Filipinas has close at hand, since there would
be annually consumed in China more than eight millions pesos&rsquo;
worth of this article from the islands; this would permit all the
extension which they choose to give to the cultivation of this article.
And if 8,000 chests of opium produced in Filipinas would yield in China
12,000,000 dollars, the royal exchequer, which ought to secure its
proportion of the great advantages to agriculture and commerce, could
without any difficulty load that product with a duty so considerable
that it would produce four to six millions of pesos a year. [Bernaldez
therefore recommends: That the government, without abrogating the
present prohibition of the importation and use of opium in the islands,
give free permission to capitalists to cultivate the poppy and export
opium from Filipinas; that the poppy-fields be close to the capital and
enclosed; that the harvest be superintended by trustworthy persons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>from the revenue service, as is that of tobacco;
and that the entire product be deposited in the magazines of the
custom-house. That at the time of its exportation a duty of 25 per cent
be collected on the value of the opium, at the prices current in China.
That the concession of raising opium should be granted by preference to
the planters who already are maintaining large plantations of sugar,
indigo, coffee, and other useful products.]</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Of the cotton manufactures</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Madrast commerce annually carries into Filipinas
fabrics of cotton, called cambayas, to the value of $300,000 to
$350,000, a sum which the traders carry back to their own country in
cash, without taking away any natural or industrial product of
Filipinas. Likewise the Chinese carry into the islands annually, by
means of their champans, cotton fabrics with the names of <i>manta
Hipo</i>, <i>Chuapo</i>, and others, to the value of $300,000, nearly
all of which sum they carry back to their own country in cash. The
Armenians of India and the Chinese had likewise the control, from the
time of the conquest of the islands, of importing into them annually
the enormous quantity of small cotton articles [<i lang=
"es">pa&ntilde;uelos</i>] and ordinary cambayas which the natives of
the country consume, until intercourse with those coasts was
interrupted in the late war with Inglaterra. Then necessity and the
high price of those goods induced the natives of Filipinas to
manufacture them, and in such abundance that the ships which arrived at
Manila, after the peace, with those commodities suffered great loss;
and from that time the importation of those fabrics ceased, and the
natives continued to manufacture them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>in the country. This
has not been the case, however, with the fine cambayas and kerchiefs
from Madrast, nor with the cotton fabrics from China; for the former
are dyed with the beautiful and permanent Indian colors, furnished by
certain plants which are to this day unknown in Filipinas, and the
latter [are desired] on account of the very low prices at which the
Chinese sell them. Thus, although various manufacturers of Manila have
attempted to weave and dye that class of goods, they have not obtained
favorable results, and have abandoned to the Armenians and Chinese the
exclusive provision of Filipinas with those commodities. It seems
impossible that a colony in which is produced cotton of a quality
superior to that of all the other colonies in Asia, whose natives are
industrious, and where the general consumption of the country offers a
large and sure market for cotton fabrics, must be dependent for its
supply on foreign manufacturers, and carry on with them a commerce
which is one-sided [<i lang="es">pasivo</i>] and ruinous. Nevertheless,
the causes of this incongruity lie in the great population of India and
China as compared with that of Filipinas, which causes the wages paid
for the spinning of the thread (and it is this item which increases or
diminishes the cost of the woven goods) to be very low; in the enormous
crops of cotton which those countries produce as compared with that of
Filipinas, which abundance causes a diminution in the price of the raw
material there; and, finally, in the superiority of the dyes of India,
which no colony has been able thus far to imitate.</p>
<p>In order to compensate for the cheapness of hand labor in the great
populations of India and China, it is necessary that in Filipinas
cotton-spinning machinery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href=
"#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>should be introduced, and that
this project be encouraged by all means; that instructors in weaving
and dyeing cambayas and kerchiefs be taken thither from Madrast, who
shall at the same time introduce into Filipinas a knowledge of the
plants from which the Oriental dyes are obtained, with the methods of
planting and cultivating these&mdash;meeting this expense from the
communal funds of the Indians. [These measures, and the promotion
already urged for large plantations of cotton, would furnish employment
to many natives of Filipinas, and &ldquo;place in circulation within
the country itself the $650,000 which annually are carried out of it in
hard money to foreign lands for the value of the cambayas and other
fabrics imported into it.&rdquo; Moreover, a new and important line of
goods would be added to the exports of Filipinas in these fine cotton
fabrics, which would be equal to those of India and even cheaper; while
the islands can always supply their own coarse cottons much more
cheaply than these can be manufactured in Espa&ntilde;a, an industry
which should therefore be fostered in Filipinas. These coarse
commodities could thus be supplied also to Espa&ntilde;a, more cheaply
than they can be manufactured there; thus Spanish commerce would be
liberated from its present dependence upon foreign countries for them,
and the money paid for them would instead go into the hands of
Spaniards, in Spanish possessions. To secure these ends, the government
of Filipinas should be cautious in imposing import duties on the fine
foreign goods, gradually increasing them according to the ability of
Philippine manufacturers to displace foreign goods by native products.
Bernaldez therefore recommends: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>That encouragement and
rewards be conferred on those who introduce cotton-spinning machinery;
that instructors in weaving and dyeing be brought from India, as above
mentioned; that the manufacture of coarse cotton fabrics in the islands
be promoted; that duties on the fine goods should be gradually
increased; that raw cotton be permitted free exportation from the
islands; and that the authorities of the exchequer there confer on
these matters with the local manufacturers and merchants.]</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the means for establishing regular communication
and frequent and permanent mercantile relations between Espa&ntilde;a
and the Filipinas Islands.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The writer urges the necessity of more interest and
care for the needs of the islands, and action by the Spanish government
in their behalf, if they are to be retained as a Spanish possession.
For this purpose a regular commerce with the islands should be
maintained, sufficient to keep twelve ships in constant employment, six
sailing for the islands every year; and thus could be kept in efficient
condition the large force (more than one thousand two hundred) of
government employees in all the departments of the island service. He
warns the ministry against plans which may be proposed by selfish
interests and intrigues, for leaving the islands in their present
poverty and isolation from the mother country. The commercial interests
of the latter should unite to carry on this work, partly for their own
profit, partly as a matter of patriotism. &ldquo;The Filipinas Islands
ought to be the center of the Spanish government&rsquo;s power in Asia,
the great market for Spanish commerce,&rdquo; and the source of
enormous revenues to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>Spanish treasury; they should be
to Espa&ntilde;a what India is to England, and are even more capable,
by their natural endowments, of being a source of power and opulence to
the mother country. Spanish commerce is being greatly injured by the
restrictions laid upon trade with the countries of Asia, and the
treasury should adjust the duties it exacts to those of other
countries; this would put an end to the smuggling which wastes more
than half of its revenues under the present system, cheapen prices,
increase the consumption of goods, and augment the revenues of the
crown. Bernaldez compares the restrictive Spanish policy with that
pursued by the Dutch and English in Asia, the latter being &ldquo;based
on the principle of maintaining and protecting their principal
possessions in those regions;&rdquo; and illustrates this by allusion
to their leading colonies, while he censures Spain&rsquo;s negligence
and folly in regard to Filipinas, and her apathy in allowing foreign
nations to seize her commerce. The royal decree of January 10, 1820,
although aiding Philippine commerce only as a temporary measure, has
already done much for the islands; their commerce with Espa&ntilde;a
has placed in circulation considerable quantities of capital, and has
increased the products of agriculture and the exportation of these from
Manila to such a degree that their value has risen to almost double
what it was before. This has been mutually beneficial to both
countries; but the colony &ldquo;will become the victim of this very
prosperity&rdquo; unless the home government shall grant certain
exemptions and privileges to render it permanent and solid. The present
restrictions on Spanish commerce prevent the exportation of silver to
Filipinas, and enable the foreigners to monopolize <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>the
trade of the islands in iron, wine, brandy, paper, and other wares
which, being Spanish products, ought to be furnished by Spanish
merchants&mdash;who, in this fettered condition, are &ldquo;unable to
find any way of placing funds in Manila for the purchase of their
cargoes.&rdquo; Moreover, &ldquo;the premiums on insurance have been
considerably increased for [vessels bearing] the Spanish flag, on
account of the risk from the insurgent corsairs; and these same risks
compel the merchants to increase, for their part, the expenses for the
armament and crews of their ships.&rdquo; The merchants of Manila have
only two commodities to offer to Spanish trade, sugar and indigo, and
the latter of these is not practicable for the sole lading of a vessel;
while if the sugar crop should fail, those merchants are left without
other resource, to say nothing of the uncertainty in prices caused by
that in the number of foreign customers who will arrive at Manila. The
Spanish government, therefore, &ldquo;should open to the commerce of
Espa&ntilde;a with Filipinas a wider range of objects in all the
productions of India and China, both natural and industrial, in which
commerce can engage in speculation and with which it can furnish
cargoes for its ships;&rdquo; for the trade in sugar alone is far too
inadequate and uncertain to support the ships needed for the
maintenance and protection of Filipinas. Bernaldez urges forcibly such
action by the government, and makes these recommendations: That Spanish
ships be allowed to trade with Filipinas, without any restrictions or
duties, save that on foreign goods carried by them a duty of ten per
cent be paid, and five per cent on arrival at Manila. That returns from
these consignments which consist in products of Filipinas shall be free
from any duties or imposts whatsoever, at either <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>end
of the voyage or on their circulation in Espa&ntilde;a. That ships may
complete their cargoes at Manila, if they wish, with any products of
India, China, and other Asiatic countries, to the extent of 30
toneladas of lading for every 100 toneladas of Philippine products
carried in the vessel; these foreign goods shall pay ten per cent duty
at Manila, and ten per cent on reaching the Spanish ports, reckoned on
the cost of the goods at Manila as shown by the official registers. Any
ship-owner who shall have carried only Spanish goods to Filipinas and
Philippine products on the return trip shall be given the right to make
another voyage to the ports of India or China, carrying the goods most
suitable for those markets and returning to Espa&ntilde;a with white
cotton stuffs and other goods at their pleasure. In these latter
voyages, Spanish products carried to Asia shall be exempt from all
duties; and foreign products carried thither shall pay a duty of ten
per cent on the values in the general tariffs; and Asiatic goods
brought back to Espa&ntilde;a shall pay the same rate on the first cost
in Asia, as shown by the original invoices. That silver may be freely
exported from Espa&ntilde;a for all these trading expeditions, by
paying two per cent. And that the shipments of moneys due from the
colonial revenues to the Spanish government be made through the Spanish
ships which shall be at Manila at the beginning of the monsoon, in
proportion to their respective tonnage.]</p>

<h4 class="main"><i>Of the necessity of forming a special code of laws
for the Filipinas Islands; and of ordaining that a periodical
visitation of that colony be made by officials from the
Peninsula.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Such visitation should be made] every five years,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>by officials despatched from the Peninsula for
the purpose of inspecting the manner in which the laws are fulfilled,
and the conduct of government employees of all classes; to examine the
progress made in all the branches of administration, and matters that
are worthy of reform; to make provisional arrangements for these,
according to the instructions that shall be entrusted to them; and to
furnish information to his Majesty&rsquo;s government, from their
positive knowledge and examination of the facts. The climate of
Filipinas, and the disposition, passions, and customs of its
inhabitants, are very different from those of the two Americas, by
whose code the islands are governed. Although they form a naturally
agricultural colony, they lack agrarian laws suited to the nature and
resources of the country. The administration of justice demands many
modifications of the general laws; and the institutions of the
municipality and the [commercial] consulate, similar to those of the
Peninsula, have not corresponded to the beneficial ends which the
sovereign intended in them, on account of the character of the persons
who in Manila compose that class of corporations, and of their clashing
interests and relations. The chairs of theology, laws, and philosophy
should, I am forced to say, be abolished, on account of the abuse which
is made of the knowledge gained in those branches of learning; and in
their places be substituted chairs of agriculture, botany, mineralogy,
arts, and commerce&mdash;throwing open the colleges and universities of
Espa&ntilde;a to the natives of Filipinas who desire to cultivate the
former branches. In the laws which regulate law-suits, in the tariffs,
in the penalties&mdash;in short, in all which has been adopted from
other countries <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261"
name="pb261">261</a>]</span>and another condition of human
life&mdash;there is a certain discord with the character, usages, and
customs of the inhabitants of Filipinas which it is necessary to
correct. A periodical visitation by officials experienced in affairs,
would set everything in motion in that colony, fill the natives with
hope, correct the arbitrary use of power (which usually increased in
proportion to the distances from the center of government), and furnish
to this government accurate and impartial data for making its
decisions. It is a great mistake, in my judgment, to seek for light on
affairs of government in the colonies from the information furnished by
their authorities and corporations; they are always prone to support
their own jurisdictions or interests, and, in whatever matter these may
cross, it is impossible to expect impartiality. The laxity which the
climate inspires, the pleasures, the relations of friendship, kindred,
and interest in a small population of Spaniards - all these things
cause the neglect of affairs of government, and the domination of
private interests. Points of mere etiquette, questions of little
importance to the [royal] service, and discords (which furnish a bad
example) between married persons - it has been mainly these things
which for many years have filled the official correspondence of the
colonies and kept their authorities occupied. Many of the subjects
which are touched upon in this writing are either absolutely unknown to
the government, or have not been discussed with the specifications and
explanations which their importance deserves.</p>
<p>I have explained to your Excellency impartially the causes which
antagonize the security and progress of the Filipinas Islands; and your
Excellency <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>will recognize, by the irrefutable facts which I
have here set down, that in that colony there exist the elements
necessary for it to render itself prosperous, and to distribute its
wealth throughout Espa&ntilde;a, increasing the glory and power of her
sovereign. Your Excellency desires radical measures of reform, and
solidly-grounded plans for prosperity, because you recognize that this
is the great art of government and of political economy. I have
endeavored not to embarrass myself with the examination of one-sided
and isolated questions, but rather to rise to the comprehension of the
axioms and general principles which would give perpetual strength to
the tranquillity of the Filipinas Islands and lay the foundations for
their advancing prosperity.</p>
<p>It has already been made evident by melancholy experience that the
governmental measures adopted since the conquest of the colonies have
not been suited to their object. It is therefore necessary either to
leave existing in Filipinas the same causes which have brought other
colonies to their ruin, or to change the system without loss of time.
This great reform will assuredly be the work of the present enlightened
government of his Majesty, and the future prosperity of the Filipinas
Islands will be the grandest monument to his glory. Madrid, April 26,

<p class="signed">Most excellent Sir,</p>
<p class="signed">MANUEL BERNALDEZ PIZARRO</p>
<p>[Here follows a &ldquo;r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the measures proposed
in this memorial,&rdquo; which we have already presented by sections,
at the end of each subject treated. At the end is a list of the items
of estimated increase in the public revenues of the islands provided
the reforms advocated by Bernaldez are adopted.] <span class=

<p>[Another MS. in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, dated Madrid, July
15, 1827, is of similar scope to this; it is signed with the initials
&ldquo;P. de S. M.,&rdquo; and is addressed to the Spanish minister
Ballesteros. The writer states, in the prefatory note, that his paper
is the fruit of his many years of practical experience and observation,
being actively engaged in commerce from Manila throughout the
Philippine archipelago, in China, in all the foreign colonies of India,
and on the Pacific coasts of America; and that he has written this
paper &ldquo;in the short time since he knew the charge given to
Se&ntilde;or Bernaldez.&rdquo; He sends it to the minister to be laid
before &ldquo;the <i lang="es">junta extraordinaria</i> (or special
committee) which at that time was considering the judicious informatory
report of the auditor Se&ntilde;or Bernaldez Folgueras in regard to the
protection and preservation of the Filipinas Islands;&rdquo; and he
offers to appear before the committee in person, to give any further
information or explanation which may be desired. He states that, like
Ballesteros, he is a Galician; and he displays much enthusiasm for the
advancement and prosperity of Filipinas. This MS. is headed,
&ldquo;Impartial reflections of a Spaniard, who is enrolled among the
citizens of Manila, upon the causes of the decadence of the Filipinas
Islands, and the means which he deems most suitable for making them
productive to the central government, and for restoring them to the
state which, by their advantageous location, they are capable of
occupying.&rdquo; It begins by deploring the injury and loss caused to
the islands by the piracies of the Moros, and recommending that the
Spanish government remedy the abuses and negligence displayed in the
administration of the colony, and the enormous and extravagant
expenditure of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>funds in the wars against those pirates. This
latter could be ended by effecting the conquest of Jol&oacute;,
Mindanao, and other centers of piracy, and establishing therein
military and agricultural colonies of Visayans; this, and the
development of the natural resources of those islands, would stop
piracy and add much to the colonial revenues. Following the example of
the English colonies in America, and of the Jesuit missionaries in
Paraguay and California, agriculture should be fostered in every way in
Filipinas&mdash;where much greater success can be obtained because the
native population is large and robust, and needs not to be supplemented
by slave labor, which fortunately has been kept out of the islands.
This and other industries there can be promoted at the same time, by
proper measures. The preservation of the colony cannot be left to the
Indians, and six thousand men from Espa&ntilde;a, selected carefully,
should be sent to Filipinas as soldiers and colonists, lands being
bestowed on them; and with them should come commissioners of high
standing and integrity to reform abuses in the colony and take measures
for its benefit. Banks should be established, currency provided for,
and facilities given to all the people for securing credit when
needed&mdash;under the care, protection, and partly the management of
the government. Commerce should be made entirely free to the world, in
all kinds of products, whether native or foreign, save for the payment
of moderate customs duties. A lottery should be established; fire and
marine insurance companies should be protected; all artisans, of every
class, nationality, and religion, should be free to settle in the
islands (those who oppose this show puerile fears and absurd and
impolitic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>notions); the ownership of land should be made
secure and legal; waste lands should be brought under cultivation,
under penalty of losing title to them; such lands should be freely
granted to all, whether natives or foreigners, who will cultivate them;
and intending colonists be aided in all practicable ways, even from the
public funds. The convents and cabildos which have the administration
of funds deposited with them for the promotion of agriculture should be
obliged to render their accounts of these, and to distribute them so as
to carry out the intentions of the founders; and the funds which were
to be invested in the Acapulco trade should, as that has now ceased, be
applied to the benefit of agriculture. Foreign nations should be
allowed to send consuls to Manila, which would be a benefit not only to
foreigners residing in the islands, but reciprocally to Spaniards who
navigate the seas controlled by foreign nations. A printing-office
should be established there, and provision be made for the publication
of a daily paper devoted to commerce and industry, and having
correspondents in the other Oriental colonies to furnish information of
their progress and achievements in all the useful arts. A mint should
be erected at Manila; and the government establishments there for
making cannon and gun-powder, which now are almost useless, should be
put on an effective footing, and those articles should be supplied for
the defense of the merchant and coasting vessels. A probate court has
been formed, for the proper care of intestate property and that left to
minors; and its administration should be regulated carefully, and the
funds in its charge be administered for the benefit of its owners and
of the country. Manila <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>and its environs should be
sufficiently policed, and lawlessness curbed; vagabonds should be kept
under control, and all who employ Indian servants should be made
responsible for their conduct; and such servants should not be employed
by any one, whether Spaniard or foreigner, nor allowed to enter
colleges as students, without producing certificates from the police
department. A college should be established in which the youth should
receive instruction in <span lang="fr">belles lettres</span>, medicine,
chemistry, botany, experimental physics, and mathematics; and a
botanical garden should be made near Manila. Martins should be
introduced into Luzon, for the extermination of the locust plague. The
intendancy of the royal exchequer should be separated from the office
of captain-general, so that the intendant shall have authority to
direct the affairs of the former independently.]</p>
<p>[The writer proceeds to describe the character of the Tagalog
natives, which he paints in gloomy colors.] It is impossible to define
either the character of these Tag&aacute;los, or their
morality&mdash;although it can be said that they have none; for,
although in outward appearance they profess the Catholic religion,
inwardly and in their actions they manifest that they follow no
religion. The zeal with which the first conquistadors undertook to
instruct them in the true belief has been useless; and the watchful
care of the missionaries whom the piety of our kings has not ceased to
send to those regions has been of no avail, except to make of their
neophytes, instead of true Catholics and useful members of society, a
new species of men, who unite the slothfulness of the savages to the
vices of civilized peoples. Thus it is that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>Tag&aacute;los are fickle, vagabonds, full of
superstitions, assassins, liars, licentious but without love, adroit
thieves; and, in one word, they do not respect even the most sacred of
the laws, divine or human. They lose no opportunity to make mischief
among the authorities, and between the latter and Spaniards of all
classes; and they have the cunning to throw the blame on these last, as
being more timid. Moreover, they perjure themselves without the least
scruple; their telling the truth depends on their being more or less
carefully instructed by the parties to the suit; and unfortunate is he
who summons them as his witnesses. They do not understand love, and
their sensuality is carried to the extreme; consequently they are cruel
fathers and worse husbands, and they have not the least respect or
consideration for their wives. Paternal love is a strange thing for
them, and therefore when they punish their children they do so
barbarously, and if they begin it in the morning they do not finish
until night. The same cruel disposition is seen among the schoolmasters
who are paid by the government to teach the youth in their
villages.</p>
<p>The code of laws for the Indias, considering these Indians as
neophytes like those of the Antillas and the Americas, has made them
participants in the privileges and liberties granted to those natives;
and it exempts them from the penalties of which they render themselves
worthy by the atrocious crimes which they continually commit. Incest,
for example, is a common vice among them, for which opportunity is
given by the little privacy in which the families live; for the mother,
daughters, and sisters all sleep in one bed [<i lang="es">hacen cama
redonda</i>], without any other separation from the men than merely a
blanket. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>It is difficult to prove this crime among them,
and only the cura or missionary could rebuke them and apply the proper
correction, in their wrongly-understood condition of neophytes, if in
confession they should reveal their sin; but, as lying is their
dominant vice, they are silent or else deny it, and the cura cannot,
even when he knows of it, obtain any satisfaction from them. The
capital and its environs are the refuge of the more perverse, who
migrate from the provinces and from their villages, in order not to
work and to relieve themselves from paying the tribute. There they
devote themselves to studies in the colleges of Santo Tomas, San
Jos&eacute;, and San Juan de Letran, making progress in a short time,
and deceiving the professors with their apparent ingenuousness; at the
same time they are occupied as servants to the Spaniards and
foreigners, but only nominally, since they do not go to their
master&rsquo;s house except for eating, sleeping, and stealing from him
(which they do with astonishing dexterity). After a little time, having
abused the master&rsquo;s patience, and having violated his wife,
daughters, and other relatives, if he has such (without respecting even
those who have not reached the age of puberty), they end by departing
with the utmost coolness; and in order to avoid recognition, and so
that they cannot be caught if they happen to be pursued, they employ
the trick of shaving the head, and, while naked, anointing the entire
body with oil, and then take to flight, with no other covering than a
mere breech-clout. The poor Spaniard, although he finds that he has
been robbed, does not think of resorting to the magistrates to make
complaint, for he knows that instead of doing him justice they would,
after making him spend much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>money, sentence him to pay the
costs and exculpate the Indian, regarding the latter as a neophyte.
Still less does he say a word about the rape, in order not to make
public his own dishonor. Let it not be supposed that this occurs only
among private persons; for there have been persons in authority who
have experienced in their own houses similar acts of insolence from
these vicious and immoral neophytes. After these evil deeds, they
disappear, as I have said; and in a very short time they are seen
returning from Ilocos, Camarines, and Ceb&uacute;, ordained as clerics,
with what sort of character may be understood&mdash;now cleansed from
all their crimes, and absolved from guilt and penalty, to continue
their studies in the colleges. Thus they graduate as bachelors and
doctors, and secure curacies, in which they commit the acts of folly
which may easily be inferred, and which it would be tedious to explain
here; and with their corrupt behavior they set an example to their
parishioners of dissoluteness, impiety, and slothfulness.</p>
<p>[The writer then enumerates the good qualities of this people, so
far as they go. They are inclined to the arts and sciences, and learn
quickly, and their deficiencies therein are due only to their lack of
books for their instruction, and tools with which to finish off their
work; this is mainly due to their improvidence, &ldquo;for an Indian,
even though he is a doctor and a cura, is unable to save one cuarto for
purchasing those things, no matter how cheap they may be; on the other
hand, he will, if he needs money for his vices, pledge his breviary or
sell his missal.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nevertheless, they exercise all the
occupations except those of silversmith, tailor, and watch-maker, for
no one would trust them [in these];&rdquo; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>lack
of tools prevents them from doing as good work as Europeans. They have
taste in the fine arts, and almost all the buildings are planned by
them. They are excellent artillerists, and a French naval commander (in
1798) thought them better than his own; and are useful in naval fights,
on account of their courage and agility. An Indian will in a few
days&rsquo; practice understand as much of seamanship as a European
would gain in twenty years; and many of them have migrated from the
islands as seamen on the ships. But they resent being called
&ldquo;negroes,&rdquo; and in several cases where they have been thus
affronted they have mutinied, killed the Europeans, and fled with the
ship and cargo. So great has been this migration that in the other
colonies of Asia rigorous measures have been taken to stop it, and
&ldquo;in all the ports of India, the entrances and roads are full of
gibbets on which men from Manila are hanged, for a warning; but, seeing
that this had no effect, all the owners and captains of merchant ships
have been compelled by law not to receive on their vessels more than
four or six of these Indians.&rdquo; The Tag&aacute;los are free with
their money, and readily lend to any European whatever they may
possess. They take great care of their fighting cocks (&ldquo;who are
for them actual idols&rdquo;), are very temperate in eating and
drinking, and are never seen intoxicated. They are often devoted to
agricultural labor, and will do well in it when they are supplied with
better methods and appliances.]</p>
<p>[Some account is given of the Negritos and other wild tribes of
Luz&oacute;n; and it is stated that any colonist who wishes to settle
among them will be able to succeed in any agricultural or other
enterprise which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span>he may undertake, if he will obtain the
consent of the chiefs, pay the savages whom he may employ exactly what
he has agreed to give, and not annoy them with matters of religion. As
for the civilized Tag&aacute;los, their women are entirely different
from the men; they are kind, hospitable, and industrious, and, although
coquettish, are very modest and decorous in behavior. They sow the
rice, and gather all the crops; roll cigars, and weave beautiful
fabrics of cotton and abac&aacute;; and embroider beautifully, besides
making hats, mats, and many other articles. In fine, &ldquo;if it were
possible to put an end to all the men and leave only the women, or
rather unite them to other men who would possess their good qualities
and think as they do, Filipinas would come to be the most wealthy and
fortunate country in the universe.&rdquo; It is certain that
agriculture would be the best mode of life for the Indians, and they
ought to be urged to engage in it, after the examples furnished by the
Jesuits in Paraguay, the Quakers in America, and other successful
colonists. The writer suggests various means to stimulate the Indians
to greater industry (especially as the Spaniards cannot undertake work
in the fields), and for the formation and management of agricultural
enterprises; he would have them well treated, promptly and justly paid,
and supplied with house, land, and suitable amusements. It has been a
great mistake to prohibit the alcaldes-mayor and other provincial
officials from owning estates there, while permitting them to engage in
trade; this policy ought to be reversed, and they be obliged to
cultivate the land, and prevented from harassing the Indians as they
have done. In forming large estates, provision should be made for the
homes of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>the laborers being comfortable, arranged in
regular streets, protected as far as possible from the danger of fire,
and shaded by trees of useful sorts; and from these should be well
isolated the proprietor&rsquo;s dwelling, sheds, machinery, and other
property. Gardens, orchards, fishponds, etc., should be formed; and all
appliances should be furnished which are desirable for improving the
quantity and quality of the products of the estate, and for providing a
safe and abundant supply of food, and of the luxuries which are dear to
the heart of the Indian. Careful directions are given for the selection
of land, the supply of water, cattle-raising, making of plantations,
protection against storms, etc. An interesting account is given of the
Chinese in Filipinas, their trade, relations with the Spaniards, the
abuses in these, the hatred felt toward them by the Tag&aacute;los
(resulting mainly from the illicit relations of the Chinese with the
Indian women), their mode of life, etc.; they should be compelled to
devote themselves only to agriculture and the useful arts, and to
abandon commerce and business entirely. They have been very injurious
to the interests of the islands, and ought to be expelled from
Filipinas, save as they are engaged in handicrafts or the tillage of
the soil. The Spaniards ought thus to follow the example of the Dutch
in Java and other islands, where the Chinese have made excellent
agriculturists and manufacturers of agricultural products, and have
enriched both themselves and the Dutch; if they had been thus treated
in Filipinas, that country would now be as prosperous and wealthy as
are the Dutch colonies, and its trade would be as rich and extensive as
that of the Dutch. As it is, enormous sums of money have been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>carried to Filipinas from Espa&ntilde;a, and
spent in the islands, with hardly any return to the mother country; and
the greater part of this wealth has been absorbed by the trade with
China, and has been stored away in that country.]</p>

&ldquo;Only since 1843 have the Chinese shops been opened on the same
terms as those of other foreigners. But there is no doubt that the
Chinese have been a great boon to the colony. They have had, in the
main, a civilizing influence on the natives, and have taught them many
important things: as the working of iron and the manufacture of sugar
from the juice of the sugar-cane. They have also ever been the leaders
in commerce and the chief middlemen of the colony; and for this reason
mainly they have been deemed an unwelcome necessity, for, without them,
trade would almost be brought to a standstill, and, in consequence,
labor would suffer and living be rendered dearer to every class. By
their superior shrewdness and unscrupulous cunning they have, on the
other hand, excited the hatred of the natives, who despise them for
their cowardice. Thus, from time to time, the feeling against them is
very bitter. Another objection against the Celestial is that he
underbids all competitors, working for what others refuse. Furthermore,
he spends little, and all that he saves he carries to his own country.
Their expulsion, however, would be as unwise as it is impracticable,
and the only remedy that meets the case is a proper State-control. The
employment of coolie labor, notwithstanding, is at present impossible,
on account of the hatred that the lower-class natives feel toward them.
In Manila there are at present no less than 40,000 Chinese, while the
whole colony contains about 100,000. They have their own courts, their
guilds, and secret societies, which are necessary for their
self-protection; and they choose representative deputations to
represent them in the Government.&rdquo; (Lala, <i>Philippine
Islands</i>, pp. 104&ndash;106.)</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Le Gentil says (<i lang="fr">Voyage</i>, ii,
p. 101) of the banishment of the Chinese from Manila in 1767 (at which
time he was residing there): &ldquo;I did not know any Spaniard in
Manila who did not sincerely regret the departure of the Chinese, and
who did not frankly admit that the Philippines would suffer for it,
because the Indians are not capable of replacing the
Chinese&#8202;&hellip;. The Parian was a sort of market, where could be
found provision of everything necessary for living; and it is not
without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232n" href="#pb232n" name=
"pb232n">232</a>]</span>reason that the Spaniards regretted the loss of
this laborious people.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

&ldquo;This spirit of greed compelled the Chinese to abandon in their
internal commerce the gold and silver coins which were in general use.
The number of those who made counterfeit money, which was continually
increasing, permitted no other line of conduct; and money was no longer
coined save in copper. This metal, however, having become scarce, in
consequence of events which history does not record, the shells so well
known under the name of &lsquo;cauris&rsquo; [English,
&lsquo;cowries&rsquo;] were mingled with the copper coins; but the
government, having observed that the people were dissatisfied with so
frail an article, ordered that the copper utensils throughout the
entire empire should be given up to the mints. As this ill-judged
expedient did not furnish resources adequate to the public needs, the
government caused about four hundred temples of Fo&eacute; to be
demolished, the idols in which were melted down. Finally the court paid
the magistrates and the army partly in copper and partly in paper; but
the people rebelled against so dangerous innovation, and it became
necessary to give it up. Since that time, which was three centuries
ago, the coinage of copper is the only legal one.&rdquo; (Raynal,

<p class="first">Three times in their history have the Philippines had
representation in the Spanish national Cortes,<a class="noteref" id=

1820&ndash;1823, and 1834&ndash;1837. In the first two periods is
emphasized the backwardness of the Philippines politically as compared
with the Spanish-American colonies. In all three periods, one cannot
point to any single great measure that was enacted solely at the
initiative of the Philippine representatives (unless with the possible
exception of the suppression of the Acapulco galleon), and indeed, not
to a great many in which they took part.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>With Fernando virtually a prisoner in France (where he remained for
five years), the nationalists in Spain being without a ruler, since
they refused to consider Joseph Bonaparte as king, organized a
provisional government known as the central governing assembly
(<i lang="es">Junta central</i>), with headquarters in the south. This
Junta, taking the necessary steps for the reorganization of government,
and the calling of a Cortes, proceeded, on June 25, 1809, to
rehabilitate the old Consejo de Espa&ntilde;a, and on January 29, 1810,
to constitute the supreme Consejo de Regencia. The delegates to the
first session of the Cortes, for which final orders were issued by
decree of June 18, 1810, and in which, by a decree of January 22, 1829,
all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>the Spanish domain was to have equality of
representation, assembled on the island of Le&oacute;n during the month
of August, 1810. On account of the distance of the American countries
and the Philippines and the impossibility of regularly-appointed
delegates reaching Spain in time for the opening of the session,
substitutes were chosen from residents of those countries then in the
Peninsula. Consequently, at the opening of the Cortes, September 24,
1810, the Philippines were represented by Pedro P&eacute;rez de Tagle,
an officer in the corps of the Spanish Royal Guards, and Dr.
Jos&eacute; Manuel Couto, prebend of La Puebla. The election at Manila
(held by order of the Regency, February 14, 1810), resulted in the
choice of Ventura de los Reyes, a wealthy merchant of Manila, and on
the whole an active representative, who, despite his seventy years, set
out immediately for C&aacute;diz. The two substitutes above mentioned
took but little part in affairs.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4114src"
href="#xd27e4114" name="xd27e4114src">3</a></p>
<p>Several general measures enacted by the Cortes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>touch the Philippines incidentally.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4126src" href="#xd27e4126" name="xd27e4126src">4</a>
The first matter, however, specifically connected with the Philippines
was the receipt by the Cortes (March 16, 1811) of the report of the
governor of the Philippines (dated August 8, 1809) in regard to the
French vessel &ldquo;Mosca,&rdquo; which had been captured by the
parish priest of Batangas (Fray Melchor Fernandez), and the despatches
carried on that vessel. The reading on April 26, 1812, of the proposed
decree prescribing the manner of holding elections in the regular
Cortes to be convened in 1813, aroused lengthy discussion.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4144src" href="#xd27e4144" name="xd27e4144src">5</a>
On May 6, Reyes moved that a special form of election be granted for
the Philippines because of their distance and the character of their
inhabitants. The islands had neither the funds nor the men to send by
which equality of representation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>would be justified, and he
requested that it only be declared that they must not send less than
two. An amendment offered by the committee on the Constitution proposed
that to the instructions regarding the elections in Ultramar be added a
clause to meet Reyes&rsquo;s wishes, but the matter was hotly contested
by the American representatives who feared that such a clause might
sometime lead to the cutting down of their own representation, and as a
consequence the proposal of the committee was not voted on.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4149src" href="#xd27e4149" name=
"xd27e4149src">6</a></p>
<p>In January, 1813, after recommendation by the committee on Ultramar,
it was resolved to grant the petition of the board (<i lang=
"es">mesa</i>) of the Misericordia of Manila (which had been hanging
fire in the Cortes since September 25, 1812), asking for certain
reforms, among them that the number of persons voting for the electors
of the board itself be reduced.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4160src"
href="#xd27e4160" name="xd27e4160src">7</a> On January 6, 1813, the
proposed ordinances for the hospice for the poor at Manila (the
establishment of which was provided for by royal order of December
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>27, 1806), were declared unconstitutional by the
committee on Ultramar,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4168src" href=
"#xd27e4168" name="xd27e4168src">8</a> and that committee&rsquo;s
report was adopted. A minute in the records of March 11, 1813, shows
that the suppression of the brandy monopoly had been decreed by the
governor of the Philippines and that it could be manufactured freely in
the provinces of Tondo, Cavite, Bulacan, and Pampanga.</p>
<p>By far the most important measure affecting the Philippines,
however, was the suppression of the Acapulco galleon.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4173src" href="#xd27e4173" name="xd27e4173src">9</a> The
discussion on the matter was lengthy and bitter, and arose over one of
twelve propositions submitted by Reyes on February 11, 1813, to the
effect that the determined suppression of the Acapulco galleon be
published, and in its place those engaged in that commerce be allowed
to fit up private vessels at their own cost to continue the trade with
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, through the ports of Acapulco, San Blas, or any
other, under the old terms of 500,000 pesos for the outgoing voyage and
1,000,000 for the return, and a lowering of the duties by one-half. The
matter was debated in the presence of the secretaries of the Peninsula
and Ultramar, and after full <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href=
"#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>discussion, in which many of the
delegates took part, and in which the American delegates generally
favored a liberal policy for the Philippines, the decree suppressing
the galleon was finally issued on September 14, 1813.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4178src" href="#xd27e4178" name="xd27e4178src">10</a></p>
<p>The special session of the Cortes closed on the date of the decree
above, and the regular session opened at C&aacute;diz, either in the
latter part of September or the first part of October. On October 4,
the last meeting was held in C&aacute;diz and opened again in the
island of Le&oacute;n because of yellow fever in the former place. On
the eighth of that month, Reyes presented three plans for the benefit
of the agriculture, industry, commerce, and navigation of the
Philippines. On the twenty-ninth of October meetings at the island of
Le&oacute;n were suspended, and resumed again in Madrid, on January 15,
1814. Fernando VII, released by order of Napoleon, after the disastrous
campaign conducted by Joseph in Spain, abolished the Cortes by his
decree of May 4, 1814, and on the publication of this decree in Madrid,
on the thirteenth many of the members of the Cortes were arrested, all
the acts of the constitutional government were declared null and void,
the Inquisition re&euml;stablished, and absolutism was again proclaimed
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>Spain. On the publication of the decree in the
Philippines, the Ilocans, deeming it only a ruse of the governor,
revolted, sacked churches and convents, and destroyed public records.
Their insurrection was directed chiefly against their own <i lang=

paramount interest, so far as the Philippines are concerned, although
the matters of elections, revenues, and ecclesiastical affairs were

the session, which accordingly was opened next day. On November 4, the
Philippine government and governor were arraigned by representative
Lallave of Veracruz for electing only four instead of the twenty-five
representatives to whom they were entitled. Discussion of this matter
resulted in the Cortes directing the Minister of Ultramar (February 11,
1822), that the Philippines, notwithstanding claims of distance and
poverty, were to elect their whole quota to Cortes. At the secret
session of February 12, 1822, it was decided to allow Arnedo and

regularly-elected Philippine representatives of the next session. This

<p>The first preliminary meeting of the regular session was held
February 15, at which Vicente Posada, a former magistrate of the Manila
Audiencia, presented himself as a regularly-elected representative from
the Philippines. He was not, however, allowed to take his seat in this
session, which opened formally on March 7, and closed on July 30, as it
was claimed that his resignation had not been confirmed and that he was
consequently still a government employe.<a class="noteref" id=

absolutists gaining control through the invasion of the French, nothing

by Fernando on October 1, who declared all their acts from March 7,
1820, to that time null and void. Posada was one of those condemned by
Fernando after his entrance into Madrid, for his liberal tendencies. By
decree of December 25, 1823, Fernando communicated to America and the
Philippines the re&euml;stablishment of absolutism, the suppression of
the Constitution of 1812, and the abolition of all the organisms
inaugurated during the constitutional r&eacute;gime.<a class="noteref"

the Manila Ayuntamiento. Camba sailed for C&aacute;diz on the
&ldquo;Santa Ana&rdquo; on March 21, and arrived in Spain August 20,
1835, after the end of the first session of the Cortes. That session
imposed a special tax on certain classes of financial documents, which
affected all the Spanish domains; and which was sanctioned by the
regent, May, 1835, and communicated to the Philippines on June 2.</p>
<p>The new session was set in a meeting of the <span lang="es">Consejo
de Ministros</span> (September 28, 1835) for November 16, 1835. The
first preliminary meeting was held on November 12, at which the
Philippine representatives presented their credentials, being duly
confirmed on the meeting of the fourteenth, although Camba was
contested by one Manuel Cacho of Manila. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>The formal opening of
the session occurred on the sixteenth, and on the twenty-fourth, Camba
and Lecaros took the oath, the former being placed on the committee on
Etiquette. On the occasion of the vote of confidence in the government,
the Philippine representatives spoke on the rumors of the transfer of
the Philippines to a foreign government, stating that such rumors had
already been reported in foreign newspapers, as well as the power to
whom the transfer was to be made and the sum to be paid. Such a sale
they could not believe would be the reward of so many years of loyalty
to the Spanish government. In the discussion of the election law for
the Cortes, the government and the Cortes came to a deadlock, and the
Cortes were dissolved by the government. Hence nothing was accomplished
during this session.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4348src" href=
"#xd27e4348" name="xd27e4348src">30</a></p>
<p>A royal decree of the date when the Cortes were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>dissolved, ordered the new Cortes to assemble at
Madrid, March 22, article 5 of the decree specifying that elections
should be held in the provinces of Ultramar on receipt of the decree.
Consequently, at this session, which lasted from March 22 until May 23,
when it was again dissolved, the Philippines had no representation.</p>
<p>A decree of May 24 ordered a new session for August 20, at which the
Philippines were to have four representatives, the officials evidently
not taking into account the distance of the Philippines from Spain, for
it would be manifestly impossible for any representative to arrive from
the Philippines for that session or even for the one of March, 1837.
The election at Manila held in 1836 resulted in the reelection of Camba
and Lecaros. On August 13, a royal decree (in consequence of the mutiny
of La Granja) ordered the publication of the Constitution of 1812 until
the Cortes clearly manifested their will or drew up a new constitution.
Another decree of August 21 called the general Cortes for October 24,
in accordance with the rules of the Constitution of 1812; and one of
September 28 suppressed the Real Consejo de Espa&ntilde;a &eacute;
Indias. At the secret session of the Cortes on January 16, 1837, a
proposition for special laws to govern Ultramar was made, being passed
to the proper committee. On February 10 the committee having in charge
the drafting of a new constitution, presented a plan for the provinces
to be ruled by special laws, in accordance with which their delegates
were not to sit in the Cortes. On March 9, 1837, the elections at
Manila resulted in Camba and Luis Prudencio Alvarez y Tejero,<a class=

a resident of Manila for thirteen years, being elected. The latter
arrived in Spain after the passing of the law excluding the Philippine
representation from the Cortes. A royal order of May 31, 1837,
presented the method to be observed in the provision of alcaldes-mayor
for the Philippines. On June 18, the new constitution was promulgated
in Madrid, article 2 of which decreed that Ultramar should be governed
by special laws.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4377src" href="#xd27e4377"

Cortes, as first known by the Spaniards, contained three divisions, the
three estates; the ones called in the three periods above-mentioned had
but one chamber; the present Cortes contains two houses, the senate and
the congress or house of deputies or representatives. The senate
consists of three divisions: senators in their own right (the heir
presumptive, the grandees, archbishops, etc.; life senators appointed
by the crown; and those elected by the people, half of whom are
removable every five years. Members to the lower house are elected for
five years by electors chosen by the people. No Cortes was held from
1713&ndash;1789, and from the latter year until 1810.&nbsp;<a class=

latter, indeed, was granted permission (January 4, 1811) to go to
Veracruz for his health; and on July 22, 1811, permission was given to
the former to go to the Philippines on private business, although he
was later forbidden to leave until the return of his colleague, as his
absence before that time would leave the Philippines without
representation. The request was renewed on the arrival of Reyes
(December 6, 1811), and on the latter&rsquo;s assumption of his seat
(December 9), Perez de Tagle was allowed to leave. On September 19,
1813, a discourse was pronounced at Manila by Jos&eacute; de Vergara,
&ldquo;deputy-elect for the province of Manila to the general
Cortes,&rdquo; and published in that year at Sampaloc. The election of
deputies in that year was regulated by a junta composed of Governor
Gardoqui, Archbishop Juan de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, Manuel D&iacute;az
Cond&eacute;, and three others; one of their decisions exempted the
very poor in the community from contributing to the fund raised for
paying the traveling and other expenses of the deputies to the Cortes.

senior regidor, the syndic procurator-general, and two commoners (these

for each 60,000 people. (See the essential clauses of this decree in
Montero y Vidal, <i lang="es">Historia general</i>, ii, pp. 406, 407.)
On the same day was also decreed the creation of provincial
deputations, of which one was specified for Manila. In this session of

Spanish bottoms to any point of the Spanish monarchy free of export and
import duties; trade on the northwest coast of America with Spaniards;
and that the permission be conceded to bring back all unsold goods (in
addition to the amount of imports allowed), on payment to the treasury
of a 6 per cent duty. The answers to these requests were as follows:
the Acapulco ship was suppressed by order of April 23, 1815; permission
of export to the value of 750,000 pesos; the ports of Callao and
Guayaquil thrown open to Philippine trade; traffic with the Spaniards
on the northwest coast of America; permission to bring back unsold

secretary of Hacienda considered the privileges of the company for the
importation of cotton goods as unconstitutional and contrary to the
prosperity of national manufactures. At the meeting of August 18, it
developed that the company had transferred its monopoly to a foreign
merchant of C&aacute;diz. The company was allowed to present its
argument, but the report of the committees on Commerce and Hacienda was
adopted. Later the company presented a petition requesting the
liquidation of the government&rsquo;s indebtedness to it, the privilege
of selling its stock of cotton goods, and various other concessions
incident to the closing up of its affairs. This petition, sent to the
Cortes by the secretary of Hacienda, was referred to the committee on
Commerce on November 2. On the fifth, a petition was presented by the
Philippine representatives and Gregorio Gonzales Azaolo, of Sevilla,
asking that the prohibition of the importation of cotton goods should
not affect the Philippines until the industry was developed or
established in those islands. This petition having been referred to the
committees on Commerce and Hacienda, their report on November 8
recommended the opening of the Oriental trade to all Spaniards trading
in Spanish bottoms. This recommendation was embodied in article 3 of
the decree of November 9, specifying the kinds of goods which Spanish
ships trading by the Cape of Good Hope could introduce into Spain or
Spanish America.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

decrees of the <i lang="es">Diarios de las Cortes</i> show no decree of
this date confirming a previous decree of March 7, 1820, granting
exemption of duties for ten years on natural and industrial products of
the Philippines, when imported in Spanish bottoms into the Peninsula,
as declared by Montero y Vidal. The decree of December 21, 1820,
providing for the abolition of the monopoly on tobacco and salt after
March 1, 1821, and providing customs and consumption duties, seems not
to have affected the Philippines.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

October, 1820, the preliminary board for the election of
representatives was organized in Manila, but inasmuch as the elections
were not held until after the Constitution had been sworn to in Manila
in May, 1821 (and later in the provinces), no regularly-elected
representatives were present at the second session.&nbsp;<a class=

special discussion arose over the item of 50,000 reals for missions and
a note in the report reflecting on the native clergy in the
Philippines. Some of the Americans, who were quite fully imbued with
the free thought of the French philosophical school, declared for the
suppression of the missionaries (meaning friars), inasmuch as they were
useless and even harmful. The committee answered this by asserting that
the missionaries in the Philippines were used by the government as
civil and political agents, and that they did do much good work in
their own legitimate line. The passage concerning the incapacity of the
native clergy was meant to apply to the Philippines alone, but if
desired it could be removed as it was not essential to the report. An
American representative moved that the 50,000 reals be used in the
establishment of normal schools in Ultramar. The Philippine
representatives seem to have taken no part in the debate except that
Camus y Herrera moved that the obnoxious clause concerning the Filipino
clergy be stricken out. The report was accepted as read.&nbsp;<a class=

university was to have a public library, a drawing school, a chemical
laboratory, cabinets of physics, natural history, and industrial
products, another of models of machines, a botanical garden, and an
experiment farm. The university to be established in Manila was to have
theological and law courses for the doctorate. Manila was also to have
a medical school, a school for veterinary medicine, a school of fine
arts, and commercial and nautical schools. Professorships were to be
filled by competition, and those for the Philippines were to be
examined by persons designated by the Subdirection of Studies in
Mexico. Girls were to be taught to read, write, and cipher; while the
older female students were to be taught the work suitable to their sex.
This matter of education for girls was left to the provincial
deputations.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

exclusion was in accordance with a decision of the committee on
Credentials handed in February 11, 1822, to the effect that government
employes did not cease, to be such until their resignations were
accepted by the government. Posada did not present his credentials at
the meeting of February 15, declaring that they had been robbed with
his baggage en route from C&aacute;diz to Madrid. He did present them,
however, at the next meeting of February 20. At the third and fourth
preliminary meetings (February 22 and 24) the matter was debated, and
he was excluded on the grounds of being still a government
employe.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e4257src">&uarr;</a></p>

states wrongly (p. 362, ed. of 1906) that seventeen deputies were
elected and sat during the Cortes of 1820&ndash;23, and he names eight
of them. He may have confused the names of electors with those of
representatives. The four elected (of whom only three are known) were
perhaps elected for the districts of the archiepiscopal see and the
three suffragan sees of the Philippines; although Montero y Vidal says
that both S&aacute;enz de Vizmanos and Posada were elected from Nueva

Fernando&rsquo;s infant daughter, Isabel II, ascended the throne under
the regency of her mother Mar&iacute;a Cristina. Through the efforts of
the liberals, six important decrees were passed March 24, 1834:
suppression of the <span lang="es">Consejo de Estado</span>, during the
minority of the queen; suppression of the <span lang="es">Consejos de
Castilla</span> and <span lang="es">de Indias</span>, in whose place
was established a <span lang="es">Tribunal Superior de Espa&ntilde;a
&eacute; Indias</span>; suppression of the <span lang="es">Consejo
Supremo de Guerra</span>, and in its place the establishment of the
<span lang="es">Tribunal Supremo de Guerra y Marina y de
Extranjer&iacute;a</span>; suppression of the <span lang="es">Consejo
Supremo de Hacienda</span>, replacing it by a <span lang="es">Tribunal

<span lang="es">Despacho de Gracia y Justicia</span> to propose the new
organization of the <span lang="es">Consejo Real de las Ordenes</span>;
and the institution of a <span lang="es">Consejo Real de Espa&ntilde;a

first news of reform and the fact that the new Cortes were to be

sailing from C&aacute;diz in June, 1834, and reaching Manila toward the
end of the same year.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

provision was made in the third Cortes for substitute representation
for Ultramar (except in the decree of August 21, 1836, calling a Cortes
for October 24 under the rules of the Constitution of 1812), which is
in point with the ignorance manifested throughout this period by the
officials at Madrid with regard to the Philippines. This accounts for
the islands having no representation for some of the sessions of the
Cortes.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e4321src">&uarr;</a></p>

Andr&eacute;s Garc&iacute;a Camba resided in Manila during
1825&ndash;35, and became so popular that he was elected a deputy to
the Spanish Cortes; he was afterward (August, 1837&ndash;December,
1838) governor of the Philippines, and wrote a book (published at
C&aacute;diz, 1839) regarding his experiences while holding that
office. Himself liberally inclined, he was constantly opposed by
reactionary influences. Although his name does not appear in the
pamphlet <i lang="es">Filipinas y su representaci&oacute;n en
Cortes</i>, he is generally considered as its author; and he alludes to
it in the memoir above mentioned. (Vindel, <i lang="es">Cat. bib.

proposed (<i lang="es">Filipinas y su representaci&oacute;n en
Cortes</i>, 1836) a special mode of election to Cortes for the
Philippines, which was to be by the Manila Ayuntamiento, as that was
the only political organization in the islands worth mentioning, and
was in direct contact with affairs. The law to be adopted for Ultramar,
Camba argued, must take into account the condition of the country and
the inhabitants. During this session, the Philippine representatives
presented two petitions to the Secretario, del Despacho de Hacienda,
asking in one for a moderation of the excessive duties on the
introduction of Spanish brandy into the Philippines, and in the other
the sending of few pensioners and subaltern employes to the islands, as
this was a prejudice to the native Philippine Spaniards. Lecaros
presented a plan to Mendiz&aacute;bal, the provisional president of the
<span lang="es">Consejo de Ministros</span>, for the suppression of the
monopoly on tobacco in the Philippines, but Mendiz&aacute;bal took
measures to make the monopoly more remunerative to the state. See

31, 1837, the new commercial treaty made September 22, 1836, between
the governor of the Philippines and the sultan of Jol&oacute; was
referred to the committees on State and Commerce, was reported on
favorably on October 4, and was accordingly approved on the twelfth of
October. This treaty stipulated that every three-masted schooner
porting at Jol&oacute; with Chinese passengers from Manila was to pay
2,000 pesos fuertes, and lesser boats in proportion to their size. As
the most important cargo ever sent to Jol&oacute; from Manila never
exceeded 2,500 pesos in value, it is hard to see the value of this
treaty so greatly lauded in Madrid. No Joloan vessels went to Manila.
In this matter the officials showed a woful ignorance of the
Philippines, the minister of the navy stating that all vessels stopped
at Jol&oacute; on their way to the Philippines. This treaty, as well as
the one made by the governor of Zamboanga with the chief of Maluso near
Basilan, only made the Moros bolder in their piracy. See Montero y

cabildo and the bishop of Nueva Segovia, Hernando Guerrero,
<abbr title="Ordo Sancti Augustini">O.S.A.</abbr>, go to law in regard
to the government <i lang="la">ad interim</i> of the archbishopric, the
latter claiming it by virtue of the brief of Paul V, since Pedro de
Arce, <abbr title="Ordo Sancti Augustini">O.S.A.</abbr>, has resigned
his right. The litigation lasts until Jan. 29, 1630, when Arce assumes

<p>VACANT SEE.&mdash;Ecclesiastical cabildo governs; although it is
agreed that the different members of the cabildo shall govern by
months, the dean obtains the upper hand through connivance with the

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
